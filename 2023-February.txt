Subject: [Rd] R2HTML doesn't split paragraphs originating from
 \Sexpr[results=rd]
Message-ID: <20230205160425.1e35a036@Tarkus>

Hello,

Here's an example that renders correctly using Rd2txt / Rd2latex / R
CMD Rd2pdf, but has problems under Rd2HTML:

\name{foo}
\title{foo}
\section{foo}{
  This should be on a separate paragraph

  This should be on a separate paragraph

  This should be on a separate paragraph

  \Sexpr[stage=render,results=rd]{
    paste(
      rep('Sexpr: This should be on a separate paragraph', 3),
      collapse = '\n\n'
    )
  }
}

For the text I've typed manually, there are <p>...</p> tags splitting
the text separated by empty lines into paragraphs. The \Sexpr return
value only has newlines, which joints the paragraphs together:

<p>This should be on a separate paragraph
</p>
<p>This should be on a separate paragraph
</p>
<p>This should be on a separate paragraph
</p>
<p>Sexpr: This should be on a separate paragraph

Sexpr: This should be on a separate paragraph

Sexpr: This should be on a separate paragraph
</p>

addParaBreaks() is prevented from closing the paragraph tag because
tools:::isBlankLineRd() returns FALSE for blank lines produced by a
\Sexpr. This happens because utils:::getSrcByte() not 1 for these blank
lines. That, in turn, is because the source reference for \Sexpr values
is the whole \Sexpr tag:

# blank line from a \Sexpr
Rd[[3]][[2]][[9]][[2]]
# [1] "\n"
# attr(,"Rd_tag")
# [1] "TEXT"
getSrcref(Rd[[3]][[2]][[9]][[2]])
# \Sexpr[stage=render,results=rd]{
#   paste(
#     rep('Sexpr: This should be on a separate paragraph', 3),
#     collapse = '\n\n'
#   )
# }

# artisanal hand-crafted blank line
Rd[[3]][[2]][[7]]
# [1] "\n"
# attr(,"Rd_tag")
# [1] "TEXT"
summary(getSrcref(Rd[[3]][[2]][[7]]))
# <srcref: file "~/foo.Rd" chars 9:1 to 9:1>

I think I understand that tools:::isBlankLineRd requires
utils:::getSrcByte(x) == 1L because it may be called on things like
"\\eqn{0}\n" where the terminal "\n" might otherwise be considered a
"blank line". How to reconcile isBlankLineRd with blank lines not
directly originating from Rd source?

Rd2latex might have a similar problem (its addParaBreaks() checks for
isBlankLineRd()), but then it works anyway because Rd rules for
paragraph breaks on blank lines are the same as in LaTeX.

Ivan

Subject: [Rd] Unnecessary note when import only used in arg definition
Message-ID: <CAEKh8ujzyH=Lhd49yc58=1Q4MxiGbjFpfQ13Rp+dEUQFA0Yr8g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear r-devel,

When a package is only used in an argument definition, e.g :


f <- function(test = testthat::is_testing()) {

  if (test) 1 else 2

}


R CMD CHECK gives us a note: "Namespace in Imports field not imported from:
'testthat'"


This incites me to remove the package from the Imports field but that'll
make my package brittle.


I noted I'm not the first one having the issue (
https://github.com/r-lib/devtools/issues/2456 ) and I've seen some
workarounds too, in particular Hadley Wickham suggests in 'R packages' to
use the following construct :


ignore_unused_imports <- *function*() {

  aaapkg::aaa_fun

}


That's far from obvious though, and not very satisfying.

Are there any downside to removing this note in this scenario? it makes
little sense to me and incites wrong behaviour AFAIU.


Thanks,


Antoine

Hi Antoine,

Maybe I'm misunderstanding, but I think the warning is saying that
you've declared the package dependency in the DESCRIPTION file, but
you haven't actually imported the package (or any functions) in your
package NAMESPACE file?

I put together an example package that I think satisfies the point
you're describing, and I don't see any R CMD check warnings (using R
4.2.2).

https://github.com/kevinushey/imports.example

As I understand it, if you declare a package dependency in the
DESCRIPTION file, you need to clarify how you're using the package in
the NAMESPACE file -- e.g. what symbols you want to import, and so on.

Best,
Kevin

I think the usual rule is that a qualified use of a package is 
sufficient to suppress the warning without any entry in the NAMESPACE 
file.  So if there isn't something else going on, Antoine's example 
illustrates a bug (or at least an inconsistency) in the check code.

Here's a version of your example that doesn't import anything from rlang 
using the NAMESPACE, but uses it in code:

   https://github.com/dmurdoch/imports.example/tree/explicituse

And here's one like Antoine's, where the only use is in a default value:

   https://github.com/dmurdoch/imports.example/tree/defaultvalue

The first one tests clean, the second one gives the note he was talking 
about:

  ? checking dependencies in R code ... NOTE
    Namespace in Imports field not imported from: ?rlang?
      All declared Imports should be used.

Here's where the problem arises:

https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/blob/7a2207dad15b8eed8c3d1c5cc49f29d431c289bd/src/library/tools/R/QC.R#L2105

with code

   if(is.call(e) || is.expression(e)) {

While examining a function definition, the arguments are stored in a 
pairlist.  The test is looking for a call or an expression, and a 
pairlist isn't any of those, so it skips over it.  I think it would work 
properly if that line was changed to

   if(is.call(e) || is.expression(e) || is.pairlist(e)) {

because then it would iterate over the arguments, and would find the use 
of a package in a default value.

Whoops, I think that's the wrong location.  I think this is the right one:

 
https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/blob/7a2207dad15b8eed8c3d1c5cc49f29d431c289bd/src/library/tools/R/QC.R#L5754

There are two similar functions in that big source file.

Subject: [Rd] Compiling R-devel on older Linux distributions,
 e.g. RHEL / CentOS 7
Message-ID: <CABtg=KnOdkTL1L3wK=Q7D1vi6ubOz=1vM0r2TY_W498h_HxUqg@mail.gmail.com>

As preparation for the next release, I am trying to compile R devel on
RHEL / CentOS 7, which is still supported by RedHat until 2024 June.
There are two issues.

One is that the libcurl version in CentOS 7 is quite old, 7.29.0, and
R devel now requires 7.32.0, since 83715 about a week ago. This
requirement is here to stay for R 4.3.0, right?

The second is that the recommended packages are now installed with R
CMD INSTALL --use-C17, which fails on CentOS 7 with

begin installing recommended package MASS
* installing *source* package 'MASS' ...
** package 'MASS' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked
** using non-staged installation

Error: C17 standard requested but CC17 is not defined
* removing '/root/R-devel/library/MASS'

CentOS 7 has GCC 4.8.5, which does not have a -std=gnu17 option.
However the commit message of this change in commit 83566 hints that
this requirement might be temporary. Hence my questions.

Is the C17 requirement temporary or it will be a requirement for R 4.3.0?
Should I expect any problems if I remove the --use-C17 flag for
installing the recommended packages?

There are a lot of R users still on RHEL 7, so it would be great to
know what to expect for the next release.

Thank you,

Unless we revert it.  The comment in the manual says

@c libcurl 7.32.0 was released in Aug 2013

and Centos 7 was released in 2014-07-07, 11 months later.  Do they 
really never security-patch libcurl?

It is temporary -- needed for survival (now updated) and mgcv (awaited). 
  However,

1) You should be able to set

CC17="gcc -std=gnu11"

in config.site, as C17 is a bug-fixed C11.

2) Centos 7 has later compilers available, and people are going to need 
them for C++.  The manual says

     ... later compilers are available: for RHEL/Centos 7 look for 
?devtoolset?.

Not with that compiler.

hello , everyone:

 I recheck and retest about the patch about high dpi of windows R GUI ,  IMO it works mostly. Last thing I am not sure is screen reader.

 I download NVDA screen reader, and try it on high dpi R GUI , in NVDA Speech viewer,  it seems it can read R GUI normally, but since I konw so little about screen reader before.   I couldn't confirm NVDA Speech viewer indeed work on high dpi R GUI.

Could anyone who know screen reader , help me  to confirm the high dpi patch not break screen reader.

I put the patch https://github.com/armgong/misc-r-patch/blob/main/dpi-c-code.diff  .

If anyone need the compiled binary on windows x64 , I can upload it on github repo also.

thanks,

Yu Gong

True, but with a big asterisk. Full updates ended on 2020-08-06, and
it's been in maintenance mode since then, meaning that only security
and critical fixes are released until EOL to facilitate a transition
to a newer version. So CentOS 7 users shouldn't expect new releases of
software to be available.

I suppose that if R-devel doesn't use any API endpoint not available
in 7.29, you could just patch out that requirement. Otherwise, you
would need to build your own.

Oh, they do port all security fixes, but without changing the version,
which is the whole point of LTS. In fact, current version is
7.29.0-59, and there are probably a hundred patches on top of those 59
builds.

Exactly, here is the reference:
https://www.softwarecollections.org/en/scls/rhscl/devtoolset-7/

R 3.6.0 is the last version we support in EPEL, because EPEL is not
allowed to build on top of SCL. But you can enable SCL and install the
devtoolset available, which contains gcc version 7.3.1.

But anyway, I don't think that staying in an almost 10-year old distro
in maintenance mode and at the same time expecting a cutting-edge
version of R (or any software) is reasonable.

Message-ID: <CABtg=KnTn+QUei+4oxPBL=So2x2i7PEXTPfdrH17AqWv6K5BGg@mail.gmail.com>

More precisely the built-in Lapack module. AFAICT this is because the
f90 files are not compiled with -fpic. My output:

If I update src/modules/lapack/Makefile.in to add $(FPICFLAGS) to the
.f90 compilation, then all is good. I assume you would also want to
add -g and -O2 here, so probably some other variable is better than
$(FPICFLAGS).

I just want to add a few reasons that I know of for why users are
still on Red Hat/CentOS 7 and learned from being deeply involved with
big academic and research high-performance compute (HPC) environments.
These systems are not like your regular sailing boat, but more like a
giant container ship; much harder to navigate, slower to react, you
cannot just cruise around and pop into any harbor you like to, or when
you like to. It takes much more efforts, more logistics, and more
people to operate them. If you mess up, the damage is much bigger.

Reasons:

* Users don't have many options, but have to use what is available.

* Red Hat/CentOS is designed for long term stability and backward
compatibility. They've only done major upgrades every 3-4 years.

* Red Hat backports security fixes to old versions of common software,
which is why you see, for instance, Python 3.6 still being the
provided version, although Python made that End-of-Life in December
2021.

* HPC environments (aka "compute cluster") often have 100s to 1000s of
users. Imagine the amount of software tools and difference versions
installed in such environments.

* Upgrading an HPC environments is a major disruption for users who
rely on it in their work and research, e.g. some software stacks,
pipelines, and scripts have to reinstalled and re-coded.

* The majority of users and sysadmins prefer stability over the being
able to run the latest tools.

* Over years, stability increases the technical debt, to a point where
it is cheaper to upgrade than to stay behind.

* Even if sysadmins want to upgrade to a newer release, their hands
are often also tied, because of external factors.  For example, the
global parallel file system or the backup system you rely on has not
yet be validated for the next version of OS you want to upgrade too.
There might also be research critical scientific pipelines that does
not yet support the new version, which can be because the maintainers
of those tools don't have access to a new version to test on. GPU
drives much not be available. This is also the case for commercial
tools. Sometimes IT security requirements cannot be met on the new
version, because security scanning tools are not yet up-to-date. There
can also be hardware limitations, e.g. you might even have to replace
some central server for the whole cluster to be able to upgrade.

* Although you might want to tell everyone to just run a new version
via Linux containers, it's not the magic sauce for all of the above.
Savvy users might be able to do it, but not your average users. Also,
this basically puts the common sysadmin burden on the end-user, who
now have to keep their container stacks up-to-date and in sync.  In
contrast to a homogeneous environment, this strategy increases the
support burden on sysadms, because they will get much more questions
and request for troubleshooting on very specific setups.

Specifically to Red Hat/CentOS 7: When sites started to think about
migrating to CentOS 8, Red Hat decided to pull the plug and change
their long-term business plan.  This itself was a disruptive event,
because any plans to do a "regular" distro upgrade had to be flushed
down the toilet.  The community waited to see what would happen and
what the options would be.  A lot of sites now plan on migrating to
Rocky 8, which (AFAIU) tries to stay true to the original CentOS
mission.  This means they are waiting for third-party hardware and
software providers to validate their products for Rocky 8, e.g.
parallel file systems, backup software, software stacks, etc.

What R Core, Gabor, and many others are doing, often silently in the
background, is to make sure R works smoothly for many R users out
there, whatever operating system and version they may be on. This is
so essential to R's success, and, more importantly, for research and
science to be able to move forward.  Those endless hours spend on
trying to support some OS, even obscure ones, to pay off many times,
especially on common OSes such as Red Hat and CentOS.  You spare lots
of users and sysadmins lots of pain when you put those hours in.  So,
thank you for doing all that.

Thanks for this work. My suggestion would be to provide those
pre-built Windows binaries to maximize the chances to get the feedback
you need. The amount of people ready to, or have the setup to, build R
from source, especially so on MS Windows, is much smaller than those
who are willing to give it a quick try.

A different route to get the "latest and greatest version of R" while
sticking with an older distribution of an OS would be via docker.

At work, our linux servers run Ubuntu 18.04 on which I run an Ubuntu 20.04
docker image with (close to) the latest version of R (4.2.2) for a shiny
app I supply across the firm.

I'm fully aware of, and I understand, all the technical and
organizational reasons why there are CentOS 7 systems out there. I
only challenge a single point (cherry-picked from your list):

> * The majority of users and sysadmins prefer stability over the being
> able to run the latest tools.

This is simply not true. In general, sysadmins do prefer stability,
but users want the latest tools (otherwise, this very thread would not
exist, QED). And the first thing is hardly compatible with the second
one. That is, without containers, which brings us to the next point.

How is that so? Let's say a user wants the latest version of R.
Nothing prevents a sysadmin to set up a script called "R" in the PATH
that runs e.g. the r2u container [1] with the proper mounts. And
that's it: the user runs "R" and receives the latest version (and even
package installations seem to be blazing fast now!) without even
knowing that it's running inside a container.

I know, you are thinking "security", "permissions"...

$ yum install podman

Drop-in replacement for docker, but rootless, daemonless. Also there's
a similar thing called Apptainer [1], formerly Singularity, that was
specifically designed with HPC in mind, now part of the Linux
Foundation.

Subject: [Rd] Small typo in Writing R Extensions
Message-ID: <CABzLhzyeHpWmbToTd0OCRSCg_NVvRZ2RkxRxCVzsv03jvWyAuQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Writing R Extensions describes `R_NewEnv()` as:

```
At times it may also be useful to create a new environment frame in C
code. R_NewEnv is a C version of the R function new.env:

SEXP R_NewEnv(SEXP enclos, int hash, ins size)
```

There is a typo here where `ins size` should be `int size`.

Thanks!
Davis

We might operate in different environments, but there are lots of labs
that keep the exact same pipeline for years (5-10 years), because "it
works", and because if they change anything, they might have to
re-analyze all their old data to avoid batch effects purely from
different versions of algorithms. I can agree with this strategy too,
especially if your data are huge and staging them back on the compute
environment from cold storage can be a huge task in itself.  Then
there are reasons such as being less savvy, and bad memories from last
time they tried this (e.g. years ago), everything broke, and it took
them weeks and months to sort it out.  I'm not trying to make fun of
anyone here - it's just that on big clusters with many users, the
skill-level spectrum varies a lot.

I'm actually thinking maintenance and support. When you bring in Linux
containers, you basically introduce a bunch of new compute
environments in addition to your host system. So, instead of the
support team (often same as the sysadm) having to understand and
answer questions for a homogeneous environment, they now have to be
up-to-date with different versions of CentOS/Rocky, Ubuntu, Debian,
... and different container images. In R we often have a hard time to
even get users to report their sessionInfo() - now imagine their
container details.  If admins start providing one-off container
images, that becomes an added maintenance load. But, I agree, Linux
containers are great and makes it possible for a lot of users to run
analyzes that they otherwise would not be able to do on the host
system.

Yes, Singularity/Apptainer is awesome, especially since Docker is
mostly considered a no-no in HPC environments. The minimal, or even
zero use of SUID, these days, is great. That it runs as a regular
process as the users itself with good default file mounts is also
neat.  These things get even better with newer Linux kernels, which,
by the way, is another motivation for upgrading the OS.

That said, with Apptainer and likes, the user might run into conflicts
here, similar to what we see when users install software via Conda,
which often generals a parallel software stack to that of the host
system.  Taking R as an example, when a user installs packages, they
end up in R_LIBS_USER=~/R/%p-library/%v (*).  This is the same
directory regardless of running R on the host system, in a Linux
container, and in Linux containers based on different OSes.  So, if
they end up running a little bit here and there, which is not
unreasonable to expect if they work on different projects, then there
will a mishmash of R package binaries that are not compatible with
each other.  This happens a ton when people use Conda.  Of course, a
savvy user will at some point figure this out, and configure their
R_LIBS_USER to be agile to the environment they run, but the majority
won't notice this until it's too late.  And, boom, now you're adding
lots of load on the support team, and troubleshooting and undoing
these conflicts consumes a lot of wasted efforts.  In the worst case,
the user does not reach out for help, but in stead struggle in silence
and might work with something half broken.  From my experience at UCSF
(~2,000 users on two big clusters), this is unfortunately not that
uncommon.

(*) My wish would be if R could to include also the OS name and the OS
version in the default R_LIBS_USER, something like
R_LIBS_USER=~/R/%O-%p-library/%v, where %O would be a new
specification that expands to, say, "centos-7", "ubuntu-22.04".  That
would mitigate lots of these issues automatically.

Thanks for the feedback and questions,

Henrik

Subject: [Rd] On optimizing `R_NewEnv()`
Message-ID: <CABzLhzxrrV7AGg5nCwCdEzqB1aRcRcHByoAXrjiXgRMi7Q=4-A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I really like the addition of `R_NewEnv()` back in 4.1.0
https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/625ab8d45f86f65561e53627e1f0c220bdc5f752/src/main/envir.c#L3619-L3630

I have a use case where I'm likely to call this function a large
number of times to generate many small hashed environments, so I'd
like to optimize it as far as possible.

I noticed that it takes `int size`, converts that to a SEXP for
`R_NewHashedEnv()`, which then simply converts that back to an `int`
here:
https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/625ab8d45f86f65561e53627e1f0c220bdc5f752/src/main/envir.c#L378

I wonder if we could cut out that intermediate SEXP (along with its
protection) by adjusting `R_NewHashedEnv()` to instead take `int
size`.

I'd be happy to do a patch if that sounds good. I'd update all uses of
`R_NewHashedEnv()` to supply `int`s instead, which actually seems like
it would make every instance of calling that function simpler:
https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Awch%2Fr-source%20R_NewHashedEnv&type=code

So hopefully a win everywhere?

Thanks,
Davis

I think this was possibly a typo (ALL_FCLAGS vs ALL_FCFLAGS), plus
those flags were never set for src/modules/lapack. Hence, this seems
like a better fix, that also adds the flags to src/extra/blas.

Best,
Gabor

Subject: [Rd] A delayedAssign() variant for quoted expressions
Message-ID: <DF104F0E-5EF2-4014-976C-2CD9B0AE8EB6@uzh.ch>

It is sometimes useful to create a promise using a constructed expression, but delayedAssign will always substitute the expression argument. I am currently using this pattern to achieve this:

expr <- bquote(?)
eval(call("delayedAssign", x, expr, eval.env = eval_env))

But it would be nice if base R already had a function that takes quoted promise body. It could be named delayedAssign0 or delayedAssignq (similar to evalq). The definition of such function would be trivial (just remove substitute from delayedAssign):

function (x, value, eval.env = parent.frame(1), assign.env = parent.frame(1)) .Internal(delayedAssign(x, substitute(value), eval.env, assign.env))

Maybe R maintainers could consider adding this function? I would be happy to submit a patch. 

Best, 

Taras

Subject: [Rd] scan(..., skip=1e11): infinite loop; cannot interrupt
Message-ID: <acf79875-5042-1db1-5283-836dedd7f8a0@prodsyse.com>

Hello, All:


	  I have a 4.54 GB file that I'm trying to read in chunks using 
"scan(..., skip=__)".  It works as expected for small values of "skip" 
but goes into an infinite loop for "skip=1e11" and similar large values 
of skip:  I cannot even interrupt it;  I must kill R.  Below please find 
sessionInfo() with a toy example.


	  My real problem is a large corrupted Thunderbird email file.  It's 
file type "Mork", which is mostly standard characters with "\n" between 
records of varying length.


	  Is there some other function in R that allows me to read chunks of a 
large file like this?


	  Thanks,
	  Spencer Graves


writeLines(as.character(1:11), 'tstNums.txt')
(Tst2 <- scan('tstNums.txt', n=12, skip=5))
# works: 6 7 8 9 10 11
(Tst13 <- scan('tstNums.txt', n=12, skip=13))
# works: numeric(0)
(tst1e11 <- scan('tst.txt', n=12, skip=1e11))
# Goes into an infinite loop that I cannot even interrupt.
# I must kill R and start over.

Skipping lines is done by two nested loops. The outer loop counts the
lines to skip; the inner loop reads characters until it encounters a
newline or end of file. The outer loop doesn't check for EOF and keeps
asking for more characters until the inner loop runs at least once for
every line it wants to skip. The following patch should avoid the
wait in such cases:

Making it interruptible is a bit more work: we need to ensure that a
valid context is set up and check regularly for an interrupt.

This way, even if you pour a Decanter of Endless Lines (e.g. mkfifo
LINES; perl -E'print "A"x42 while 1;' > LINES) into scan(), it can
still be interrupted, even if neither newline nor EOF ever arrives.
(We never skip lines when reading from the console? I suppose it makes
sense. I think this needs to be documented and can write a
documentation patch.)

If you actually have 1e11 lines in your file and would like to read it
in chunks, it may help to use

f <- file('...')
chunk1 <- scan(f, n = n1, skip = nskip1)
# the following will continue reading where chunk1 had ended
chunk2 <- scan(f, n = n2, skip = nskip2)

...in order to avoid having to skip over chunks you have already read,
which otherwise makes the algorithm quadratic in number of lines
instead of linear. (I couldn't determine whether you're already doing
this, sorry.)

Skipping a fixed number of lines is hard: since they have variable
length, it's required to read every character in order to determine
whether it starts a new line. With byte ranges, it would have been
possible to use seek(), but not here.

Subject: [Rd] Unable to load Windows NETIO.SYS and WINSPOOL.DRV DLLs
Message-ID: <64d8c5ea00cccbbd6bb7f92a506e97d2e9f5168a.camel@ed.ac.uk>

I am trying to build the RGtk2 package
(https://github.com/lawremi/RGtk2) using R-devel and only the libraries
bundled with RTookl4.3 (currently RGtk2 is bundled with a compiled dll
and requires GTK libraries to be downloaded after installation into R).

I have used the instructions at
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/howto-R-4.2.html
to create a Makevars.win file (appended, including description of how
the PKG_LIBS have been set).

The package can be installed, but the shared object created can't be
loaded:

   > library(RGtk2)
   Error in inDL(x, as.logical(local), as.logical(now), ...) :
     unable to load shared object 'C:/Users/David
   Sterratt/AppData/Local/R/win-library/4.3/RGtk2/libs/x
   64/RGtk2.dll':
     LoadLibrary failure:  The specified module could not be found.

WinDbg output reveals errors loading "NETIO.SYS" and "WINSPOOL.DRV"
when running "library(RGtk2)":

   0c64:0640 @ 44312812 - LdrpProcessWork - ERROR: Unable to load DLL:

I'm stuck at this point: I'm not a regular Windows User, and I've not
been able to find any trustworthy advice online about how to deal with
missing DLLs. Any help would be appreciated.

There is an issue on Github about this issue with full output from
WinDbg:

Subject: [Rd] inconsistent use of optim's parscale in Hessian vs gradient
Message-ID: <CABeTmqjnREecftHjosBg1X46J=uRmQuZbkzhqaSz3aEdZt3Vfw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear r-devel:

I noticed that optim's finite-element derivative approximations operate on
par/parscale for the gradient (as documented in help(optim)) but on par for
the Hessian. (The same goes for optimHess, which calls the same Hessian
code.)  This seems odd, so I am wondering if it is intended.

Maybe this is all well known, and thanks if all it takes is pointing me to
any existing information on it.

Here is an example (all toy values). When parscale has its default value of
1, the issue doesn't arise.  By printing the input, we can see what grid
points are being used.

foo <- function(x) {print(x); x^4}
.External2(stats:::C_optimhess, 1, foo, NULL, list(fnscale = 1, parscale =
1, ndeps = 0.02))

With parscale = 1 and ndeps = 0.02, the grid points for 2nd derivative at x
= 1 are:
x + 0.02, x - 0.02
and then the grid points for the 1st derivative around each of those are
x + 0.02 + 0.02, x + 0.02 - 0.02 for the first (around x + 0.02), and
x - 0.02 + 0.02, x - 0.02 - 0.02 for the second (around x - 0.02).

This all makes sense. There is no problem yet.  (There is one more function
evaluation than needed, but that's not the point.)

(BTW, I'm evaluating the Hessian at 1 instead of the optimum at 0 for
illustration, but really it is just the grid points that illustrate the
issue.)

But with parscale != 1, we can see that the epsilons are used on different
scales at different steps:

.External2(stats:::C_optimhess, 1, foo, NULL, list(fnscale = 1, parscale =
3, ndeps = 0.02))

The grid points for the 2nd derivative at x = 1 are the same as above, so
they are on the par scale:
x + 0.02, x - 0.02
but the grid points for the 1st derivatives then use par/parscale, giving
x + 0.02 + 0.06, x + 0.02 - 0.06 for the first, and
x - 0.02 + 0.06, x - 0.02 - 0.06 for the second

The 0.06 increments are from 0.02 increments on par/parscale, which is then
multiplied by parscale=3 before calling foo.  Is this intended?

I believe the 2nd derivative increments on the scale of par occur at lines
461-462 of src/library/stats/src/optim.c, in optimhess, and the 1st
derivative increments on the scale of par/parscale occur at lines 138 and
146 of the same file, in fmingr.

A curious consequence in two dimensions is that the Hessian with respect to
x[1] and then x[2] uses a different four grid points than the Hessian with
respect to x[2] and then x[1], if they have different parscales.

foo2 <- function(x) {print(x); sum(x^4)}
.External2(stats:::C_optimhess, c(1,1), foo2,
           NULL, list(fnscale = 1, parscale = c(3,2), ndeps = c(0.02,
0.02)))

This prints the input x values from 16 calls to foo2, comprising 4 calls
for each of the 4 Hessian elements.

The grid points for dx[1] dx[2] are lines 3-4 and 7-8 of the output, which
are
[1] 1.02 1.04
[1] 1.02 0.96
[1] 0.98 1.04
[1] 0.98 0.96
So the dx[1] steps are on par while the dx[2] steps are on par/parscale.

The grid points for dx[2] dx[1] are lines 9-10 and 13-14 of the output,
which are
[1] 1.06 1.02
[1] 0.94 1.02
[1] 1.06 0.98
[1] 0.94 0.98
So the dx[2] steps are on par while the dx[1] steps are on par/parscale.

The code on lines 472-477 of optim.c symmetrizes the two approximations of
the same second derivative (from dx[1] dx[2] and dx[2] dx[1]) by
averaging.  This may be helpful numerically in any case, but was it
intended to be averaging over two potentially different grid schemes?

That these are the grid points being used can be confirmed by direct
computation and comparison to the value returned by optimHess.

Thanks for any insight on this.

Subject: [Rd] Line-terminal \ in character consants -- missing from ?Quotes ?
Message-ID: <CAD7Bkx91sEPFAwSc_od5UgOZ7tW9=k43hRgWVi8srv2nnLgh9w@mail.gmail.com>

I'm coming across some code that uses the fact the parser ignores a
line-terminal '\', e.g.

identical("\
", "\n")
# [1] TRUE

x = "abc \
def"
y = "abc \ndef"
identical(x, y)
# [1] TRUE

However:
identical("\\n", "\n")
# [1] FALSE

This appears to be undocumented behavior; the closest thing I see in
?Quotes suggests it should be an error:

> Escaping a character not in the following table is an error.

('\n' is in the table, but my understanding is the 'n' is what's being
escaped v-a-v the "error", which seems confirmed by the third, FALSE,
example above)

Is this a bug, is the omission from ?Quotes a bug, or is this just
undocumented behavior?

In your first example, you have a backslash which says to escape the 
next char.  The next char is a newline char.  The result is an escaped 
newline, which apparently is a newline.

The same thing happens in the second example.

The third example is an escaped backslash, i.e. a backslash, followed by 
n.  That's not the same as an escaped n, which gives a newline.

So I think the behaviour might be reasonable.

The thing I'd worry about is whether things are handled properly on 
Windows, where the newline is two characters (CR LF).  It might be that 
the backslash at the end of the line escapes the CR, and you get a \r 
out of it instead of a \n.  But maybe not, the parser knows about CR LF 
and internally converts it to \n, so if that happens early enough, 
things would be fine.

I'm still hung up on ?Quotes -- I can't see mention of 'newline' as a
valid escape. It mentions the literal sequence '\' 'n', where 'n' is
being escaped.

Glanced at the parser blame and apparently the terminal '\' is the
older behavior, and what I'm used to, i.e. literal newlines in char
constants to make multi-line strings, is new (though still 20 years
old):

https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/commit/bc3f20e4e686be556877bb6bd2882ae8029fd17f

The NEWS entry there does say the same thing as you -- "escaping the
newlines with backslashes".

>From the parser, I think ?Quotes is just missing "newline" as being a
valid escaped character, c.f.

https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/blob/f55b24945d56e824f124638c596b99887441354a/src/main/gram.y#L2823-L2830
('\n' is treated like '\')

('\n' is in the list of valid items after '\')

I don't see any special handling for '\r', so there may be a gap in
the R parser? Or I just don't understand what I'm reading in the
parser :)

Subject: [Rd] An interesting chat with ChatGPT
Message-ID: <3d7bd521-d670-4b90-6be4-a3528d726f5b@gmail.com>

I was wondering which anchor would match in the regular expression 
"(a)|(b)" if both "a" and "b" matches the target string.  What appears 
to happen is that the first match wins, and that's how it is documented 
in Python, but I was looking for docs on this in R.

As far as I can see, the ?regex help page doesn't resolve this. So just 
for fun, I decided to ask ChatGPT, and got an interesting response.  I 
won't show the whole conversation here, but just some extracts:

---------------------------------------
Me:  In a regular expression in R, if both "a" and "b" match, which does 
"(a)|(b)" match?  Please include authoritative references in your answer.

ChatGPT: [long answer about grep]

Me:  In grep(), it doesn't matter which of a or b matches.  It's only in 
sub() or gsub() that it makes a difference.  Do you know an 
authoritative reference that discusses those functions?

ChatGPT:  [long irrelevant answer about sub and gsub, with a reference 
to "R Cookbook" by P. Teetor.]

Me:  Teetor's book is not authoritative, and the other reference doesn't 
discuss ambiguous alternation.

... finally we get to the interesting part ...

ChatGPT: I apologize for the mistake in my previous answer.

A more authoritative reference for the behavior of regular expressions 
in R can be found in the official R documentation.

Regarding the behavior of ambiguous alternation, the regex section of 
the manual "An Introduction to R" explains it as follows:

"When several alternatives are possible, the first alternative is 
chosen, so it is important to specify alternatives in the order in which 
they should be tried."

Here is the reference for the official R documentation:

     "An Introduction to R" manual: 
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html#Regular-expression-facilities

I hope this reference provides the information you were looking for.
---------------------------------------


All right, an authoritative answer!  The only problem is that *it 
doesn't exist*.  There's no such anchor in that document.  R-intro isn't 
a very rapidly changing document, so I could look at every change 
recorded in svn, and that section has *never* existed.

I guess ChatGPT is a pattern matching machine, and if such a question 
had an answer, it would probably be in a location like that.  (I would 
have guessed a help page like ?regex instead of R-intro, but I had just 
told it that answer was wrong.)

I can confirm this is a bug, more specifically, a regression in R >= 
3.6.0. I think a report in R's Bugzilla would be useful.

A possible workaround seems to be to start the Rd-generating \Sexpr in 
column 1 of the Rd file, so to remove the indentation before \Sexpr.

AFAICS, fixing this will require tools:::processRdChunk() to keep two 
types of source references for dynamically generated Rd code: the 
effective "srcref" from parsing the Rd fragment, and the one that refers 
to the source Sexpr block (possibly called "wholeSrcref"), to be used by 
checkRd() in preference to "srcref" when reporting the location of Rd 
problems.

Duncan -

Indeed, this has now been well documented; I have called these constructions "Schr?dinger Facts", since they arise from a superposition of truths in the training data that collapse into an untruth when observed.

   https://sentientsyllabus.substack.com/p/chatgpts-achilles-heel

Now, the curious question is: why can it program. Why is its production of R-syntax less vulnerable to this effect than a literature quote, or reference? Maybe it has to do with the fact that in producing correct syntax there is a ground truth - errors just will not run. But I'm not sure.

Regardless: it signals that we need a reinvigorated culture of validation. Actually ChatGPT will happily make test data for you. Whisvh. in a way, it judt did  ;-)

Subject: [Rd] Documentation bug?
Message-ID: <4d27638cae924911bcd282d4d0388a93@chu-rouen.fr>

Dead R developers,

In R-devel  2023-02-11 and older R versions, there is a note in the "lm {stats}" help page specifying that:
> Offsets specified by offset will not be included in predictions by predict.lm<http://127.0.0.1:12534/library/stats/help/predict.lm>, whereas those specified by an offset term in the formula will be.

However, the source code as well as basic tests seem to show that both types of offset terms are always used in predictions.
a<-data.frame(off=1:4, outcome=4:1)
mod<-lm(data=a, outcome~1, offset=off)
coef(a) # intercept is zero
predict(mod) # returns 1:4, which uses offset
predict(mod, newdata=data.frame(off=c(3,2,5))) # returns c(3,2,5) which uses the new offset

When looking at the history of R source code, this note seems to exist from R 1.0.0 while the source code of predict.lm already called eval(object$call$offset, newdata)
https://github.com/SurajGupta/r-source/blob/1.0.0/src/library/base/R/lm.R
https://github.com/SurajGupta/r-source/blob/1.0.0/src/library/base/man/lm.Rd

Version 0.99.0 did not contain the note, but already had the call to eval(object$call$offset, newdata)
https://github.com/SurajGupta/r-source/blob/0.99.0/src/library/base/man/lm.Rd
https://github.com/SurajGupta/r-source/blob/0.99.0/src/library/base/R/lm.R

The actual behavior of R seems to be sane to me, but unless I miss something, this looks like a documentation bug.
It seems to have bugged someone before:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71264495/why-is-predict-not-ignoring-my-offset-from-a-poisson-model-in-r-no-matter-how-i

Digging deeper in R history, it seems that this note was also found in "glm {stats}" in R 1.0.0 but was removed in R 1.4.1. Maybe somebody forgot to remove it in "lm {stats}" too.

Thanks. The note is indeed outdated since at least R 2.9.0 with NEWS

     o	predict.lm() now works correctly when the fit had more than
	one offset (possibly specified both in the formula and as an
	argument).  This function is called by predict.glm(), so the
	same isses are corrected there.

It has now been removed from ?lm in r83832 in the trunk (ported to 
R-patched).

Can you help please?

All file und dir funktions and also basename() do not work in R under Windows OS
if the path is longer than?260?characters.
The problem seems to be, that the manifest for all R executables do not have the longPathAware switch in the manifest.
(The registry and or the group policy for the long path name support are enabled)

This is the correct extension for the manifest of the executables.
<ws2:longPathAware>true</ws2:longPathAware>

Is it possible to add this into all manifests for windows executables?
Or is ther an other opportunity?

Snippet from Microsoft:

<application xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v3">
<windowsSettings xmlns:ws2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/SMI/2016/WindowsSettings">
<ws2:longPathAware>true</ws2:longPathAware>
</windowsSettings>
</application>

Declaring that R is long path aware is indeed easy, however, before we 
can do this, we actually have to make it long path aware, which is a lot 
of work. Incidentally it is work in progress, I've been working on that 
in the last few weeks.

Currently, neither R-devel nor any released version of R is long path 
aware. One possible work-around is to use mapped drives to make the 
paths shorter.

Whenever possible, it is better to make the paths short, anyway, because 
a number of other applications as well as some parts of Windows don't 
support long paths. Very likely this will also be the case of 
contributed packages. Indeed, and consequently, a number of users will 
not enable long paths on their systems.

Tomas

Is there some way to avoid the automatic generation of hello* files in
package.skeleton?
I found that the following does it on Windows but then it does not
create an R directory which I still
want and also it gives warnings which I don't want.
package.skeleton(code_files = "NUL")

Subject: [Rd] Question on non-blocking socket
Message-ID: <68ce63b0-7e91-6372-6926-59f3fcfffd25@Be-Logical.nl>

Hi,

December 27, 2021 I started a thread asking for help troubleshooting 
non-blocking sockets.
While developing the RBaseX client, I had issues with the authentication 
process. It eventually turned out that a short break had to be inserted 
in this process between sending the credentials to the server and 
requesting the status. Tomas Kalibera put me on the right track by 
drawing my attention to the 'socketSelect' function. I don't know 
exactly the purpose of this function is (the function itself is 
documented, but I can't find any information for which situations this 
function should be called.) but it sufficed to call this function once 
between sending and requesting.

I have two questions.
The first is where I can find R documentation on proper use of 
non-blocking sockets and on the proper use of the socketSelect function?

The second question is more focused on using non-blocking sockets in 
general. Is it allowed to execute a read and a receive command 
immediately after each other or must a short waiting loop be built in.
I'm asking this because I'm running into the same problems in a C++ 
project as I did with RBaseX.

In addition to the demos I sent to you in that 2021 thread on 
R-pkg-devel, you could also have a look at how it is used in R itself, 
in the parallel package, in snowSOCK.R, to set up the snow cluster in 
parallel. Some hints may be also found in the blog post 
https://blog.r-project.org/2020/03/17/socket-connections-update/. But, 
in principle, R API is just a thin layer on top of what the OS provides, 
so general literature and tutorials on sockets should help, there should 
be even textbooks used at CS universities in networking classes.

Basically select() can tell you when data is ready (on input), when the 
socket interface is able to accept more data (on output) or when there 
is an incoming connection. In practice, you should not need any delays 
to be inserted in your program to make it work - if that is needed, it 
means that is an error in it (a race condition). If the program is 
polling (checking in a loop whether something has already happened, and 
then sleeping for a short while), the duration of the sleep may indeed 
influence latency, but should not affect correctness - if it does, there 
is an error.

No, in general there is no need to insert any delays between reads and 
writes, they can actually happen concurrently. But these are general 
networking questions, not the topic of this list.

A useful guide to the Berkeley sockets API can be found at
<https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/>. You'll have to translate between the C
idioms and the R idioms, but it's better than having no guide at all.
In particular, R spares you from having to figure out differently-sized
struct sockaddr objects by converting them to string representations of
the addresses (currently limited to IPv4).

In RBaseX I first calculate an MD5 hash that is send to the server and 
then I check the status byte that is returned by the server.

writeBin(auth, private$conn)
socketSelect(list(conn))
Accepted <- readBin(conn, what = "raw", n = 1) == 0

Without the second line, 'Accepted' is always FALSE. With this line it 
is TRUE.

BaseX provides example API's in several languages. I've looked at 
several but indeed none uses any form of delay.
All API's follow the same pattern, calculate a MD5, send it to the 
server and check the status byte. So the server is not likely to enforce 
a delay. So there is nothing left but to look for that racing condition ;-(

Hi,

R's software development life cycle is documented here:

??https://www.r-project.org/doc/R-SDLC.pdf

This is available via the Certification link, under Documentation, on the main R Project web page:

??https://www.r-project.org

Section 4.4 of the document, on page 10, covers the release cycles, and section 4.6, on page 11, covers maintenance, support and retirement.

Section 4.6 includes the following text at the end of that section on page 12:

"The x.y.0 releases are maintained via a series of x.y.z patch releases. At a new x.y.0 version of R, the prior version is retired from formal support.

Without knowing more details, this looks ok. If you have a non-blocking 
connection, and the server produces a response based on the client 
request, the client has to take into account that it takes the server 
some time to produce the response. Right, the sockets are full duplex 
and so could be the communication protocol, but in this case it 
apparently isn't, it is request/response.

Without the second line, there would be a race condition between the 
server sending a response and the client receiving it. With the second 
line, the client waits for the server before it starts receiving. In 
theory, one could be waiting for the response actively in a loop 
(polling), but socketSelect() is better. Both ways would resolve the 
race condition. Adding a single fixed-time wait, instead, would not 
remove the race condition, because one can never be sure that the server 
wouldn't take longer (apart from waiting too long most of the time).

In the example you are waiting only for a single byte. But if the 
response may be longer, one needs to take into account in the client 
that not all bytes of the response may be available right away. One 
would keep receiving the data in a loop, as they become available (e.g. 
socketSelect() would tell), keep appending them to a buffer, and keep 
looking for when they are complete.

Subject: [Rd] User-defined RNG with the standalone Rmath library
Message-ID: <GV3P280MB0001B9D723662634F5650DB1F0A09@GV3P280MB0001.SWEP280.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

I have two questions about using a user-defined random number generator (RNG) with the standalone Rmath library. The default RNG with the standalone Rmath library is the Marsaglia-multicarry generator, which has poor properties. The "R Installation and Administration" manual, in the section "The standalone Rmath library", states that:

```
A little care is needed to use the random-number routines. You will need to supply the uniform random number generator

    double unif_rand(void)

or use the one supplied (and with a shared library or DLL you may have to use the one supplied, which is the Marsaglia-multicarry with an entry point

    set_seed(unsigned int, unsigned int)

to set its seeds).
```

I interpret this to mean that we cannot use a user-defined random number generator with "a shared library or DLL", which suggests using static linking.

Question: are there any good examples of re-defining unif_rand() with the standalone Rmath library?

As an example, we could set up a file test.c:

  #define MATHLIB_STANDALONE
  #include <Rmath.h>
  #include <stdio.h>
  double unif_rand(void) { return 0.5; }
  int main() {
    printf("%f\n", unif_rand());
    printf("%f\n", runif(0, 1));
    return 0;
  }

If we compile using -static, then we get the correct result (two values of 0.5):

  gcc -static -o test test.c -lRmath -lm
  ./test
: 0.500000
: 0.500000

Question: does this code work for other users?

Sincerely, Mark.

Subject: [Rd] Robustifying R_CleanTempDir a bit more
Message-ID: <20230216170909.42e6894e@arachnoid>

Hello,

This is probably a very minor point, but R_CleanTempDir may still have
a shell injection in it. I couldn't find a way to shoot the user in the
foot in a significant way (by, say, accidentally removing ~), thanks to
R disallowing spaces in the path, but if Sys_TempDir somehow acquires a
value of "/tmp/';echo;'", R_CleanTempDir() will remove /tmp instead of
its aptly-named subdirectory.

While adding the single-quote symbol to the list of special symbols
should suffice (it and the backslash being the only allowed ways to
"un-quote" a single-quoted string), I would like to suggest solving the
problem without the use of quoting:

#include <spawn.h>

char ** argv = { "rm", "-Rf", Sys_TempDir, NULL };
posix_spawnp(NULL, "rm", NULL, NULL, argv, NULL);

Are there Unix-like platforms on which R is intended to work that don't
have posix_spawn()? Circa-2014 versions of both Solaris and OpenBSD
seem to have it. Spawning the process manually by means of [v]fork()
and exec() is probably not worth the maintainer effort required to
perform it correctly.

Ivan

Please see 83851 from earlier today which does a bit more of 
robustification, and if you find any problem in it, please let me know.

Yes, this is a good point and we have been thinking about spawn() as 
well, and we are considering that. Re implementing, I also fear the cost 
may be too high, thinking about the timeout support in system() I 
implemented earlier, so essentially a system() replacement for Unix. The 
details are complicated on Unix as well as on Windows. And re reusing 
existing implementations, we will have to check they do exactly what we 
need about signals, terminal, process groups, termination, input and 
output, etc. It may also be that improving performance of R_unlink() 
would be easier, as it is rather un-optimized now. So I just wanted to 
buy time with (possibly temporary) fix in 83851.

Thanks
Tomas

I've added the single quote now. Thanks for spotting that. This is a 
temporary fix which may be later replaced by spawn or something else.

83851 is an improvement, but it does let single quotes through,
unfortunately, leading to my (contrived) example of "/tmp/';echo;'". 

Given what you say about the temporary nature of the current fix,
adding the single quote to the list of special symbols should be a good
solution for now:

--- src/main/platform.c	(revision 83851)
+++ src/main/platform.c	(working copy)
@@ -1634,7 +1634,7 @@
 	/* On Solaris the working directory must be outside this one */
 	chdir(R_HomeDir());
 #endif
-	char *special = "\\`$\"\n";
+	char *special = "\\`$\"\n'";
 	int hasspecial = 0;
 	for(int i = 0; special[i] != '\0'; i++)
 	    if (strchr(Sys_TempDir, special[i])) {

At least I don't see a way out once you disallow single quotes in the
single-quoted string.

Hi,

R's software development life cycle is documented here:

  https://www.r-project.org/doc/R-SDLC.pdf<https://www.r-project.org/doc/R-SDLC.pdf>

This is available via the Certification link, under Documentation, on the main R Project web page:

  https://www.r-project.org<https://www.r-project.org>

Section 4.4 of the document, on page 10, covers the release cycles, and section 4.6, on page 11, covers maintenance, support and retirement.

Section 4.6 includes the following text at the end of that section on page 12:

"The x.y.0 releases are maintained via a series of x.y.z patch releases. At a new x.y.0 version of R, the prior version is retired from formal support. R Core?s efforts are then focused on the new Release (and the on-going Development) version. No further development, bug fixes or patches are made available for the retired versions. Thus there is always only one current version of R. However, the SVN repository will allow older release branches to be reopened, should the need arise."


Version 4.0.0 of R was released on April 24, 2020, thus ending formal support for version 3.x.x, with the last 3.x.x version being 3.6.3, which was released on February 29, 2020.

Hi Ben,

For an easier experience with sockets, you may wish to have a look at the `nanonext` package. This wraps 'NNG' and is generally used for messaging over its own protocols (req/rep, pub/sub etc.), although you can also use it for HTTP and websockets.

In any case, a low level stream interface allows connecting with arbitrary sockets. Using something like `s <- stream(dial = "tcp://0.0.0.0:5555")` substituting in the actual address. This would allow you greater flexibility in sending and receiving over the bytestream without worrying so much about order and timing as per your current experience.

For example, a common pattern this allows for is doing an async receive `r <- recv_aio(s)`  before sending a request `send(s, "some request")`, and then query the receive result afterwards at `r$data`.

I won't go into too much detail here, but as it is my own package, please feel free to reach out separately via email or github etc.

Thanks,

Charlie

     $ git log -1 b67399b
     commit b67399b40bc5bf3165b09e6a095ec941d4b30a97
     Author: Daiki Ueno <ueno at gnu.org>
     Date:   Thu May 26 13:38:57 2016 +0900

         m4: Rely less on internal symbols

         * gettext-runtime/m4/gettext.m4 (AM_GNU_GETTEXT): Skip checks for the
         internal symbols _nl_msg_cat_cntr, _nl_domain_bindings, and
         _nl_expand_alias, if __GNU_GETTEXT_SUPPORTED_REVISION is defined.
         Problem reported and fix suggested by Masanori Ogino in:
         https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gettext/2016-04/msg00000.html
         The rationale behind this is: (1) those symbol checks are for detecting
         certain broken implementations, namely NetBSD and Solaris 7, and
         (2) __GNU_GETTEXT_SUPPORTED_REVISION is not defined in those
         implementations, while it is defined on compatible implementations, such
         as musl-libc which doesn't have those internal symbols.


Can m4/gettext.m4 be regenerated from a sufficiently newer release
of GNU gettext, without major disruption?

ChatGPT provided an R code with error when I asked a question related to prediction of a new data point for linear mixed effects model.  So, it is not immune to coding mistakes!

Duncan -

Indeed, this has now been well documented; I have called these constructions "Schr?dinger Facts", since they arise from a superposition of truths in the training data that collapse into an untruth when observed.

   https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsentientsyllabus.substack.com%2Fp%2Fchatgpts-achilles-heel&data=05%7C01%7Cravi.varadhan%40jhu.edu%7C1a6aecbbe3974b52595608db0ddb3271%7C9fa4f438b1e6473b803f86f8aedf0dec%7C0%7C0%7C638119007350695881%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=WM23AlyRohiQh5EqTqkTI2B%2BXTG38k%2BtfaRv7KQwybw%3D&reserved=0

Now, the curious question is: why can it program. Why is its production of R-syntax less vulnerable to this effect than a literature quote, or reference? Maybe it has to do with the fact that in producing correct syntax there is a ground truth - errors just will not run. But I'm not sure.

Regardless: it signals that we need a reinvigorated culture of validation. Actually ChatGPT will happily make test data for you. Whisvh. in a way, it judt did  ;-)

Hi Tomas,

Apparently, inserting some kind of socketSelect() is essential when 
using non-blocking sockets and a client/erve architecture. That is at 
least one thing that I have learned ;-).

In C++, between sending and requesting, I inserted a call to this function:
bool wait(int s) {
   fd_set read_set;
   struct timeval timeout {};
   memset(&timeout, 0, sizeof(timeout));
   bool done{};
   while (!done ) {
     FD_ZERO(&read_set);
     FD_SET(s, &read_set);
     int rc = select(s + 1, &read_set, NULL, NULL, &timeout);
     done = (rc == 1) && FD_ISSET(s, &read_set);
   };
   return done;
};

Inserting this call was essential in solving my problem.

Ben

I think it is more appropriate to be a little less harsh, " no same 
person would believe EVERYTHING they say"

 ?What chatGPT (and politicians) say must be run through your own 
personal filters and sanity checks ( just like the things even your 
mother tells you.)? ;-)

Ben,

yes, by definition - non-blocking means that reads won't block and always return immediately (the point of non-blocking). The loop below is terrible as it will cause 100% CPU usage while it's spinning. It seems that you want to block so why are you using non-blocking mode? select() effectively gets you back to blocking mode, because it does the "block" that read() would normally do in blocking mode. Moreover select() allows you to block for a specified time (the point of the timeout argument) so if you want to wait, you should set the timeout - you should never use a spin loop without timeouts. Also there are many other conditions you should be handling - there may be an error on the socket or EINTR (you should call R's interrupt handler) or EAGAIN (which you do implicitly, but you can't tell it from an actual error).

Sockets and I/O are quite complex matter - it's easy to get it wrong and create hard-to-detect bugs in you code unless you are an expert in it. It's one of the wheels you don't want to be reinventing.

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [Rd] Adding support for S7 to base R
Message-ID: <CALWM=9b2izXXmLOQQOf4Ssg+11E5fdy5DfM4P2NqCPeBpLGSwg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R-devel,

We are pleased to inform you that the R Consortium OOP Working Group
has been making progress on the S7 (formerly named R7) package and are
preparing to submit it to CRAN. The S7 package is a new OOP system
designed to be a successor to S3 and S4.

As part of that effort, the group has identified a minimal set of
narrow changes to base R that would allow S7 to exist as a CRAN
package. The changes, in general, enable S7 to use R language features
that are presently limited to only S4.

The proposed patches:

-  make `@` an S3 generic.
-  make `%*%` an S3 generic.
-  enable double dispatch for S7.
-  enable `inherits()` to accept `S7_class` objects.

The diffs for the individual patches can be found here:

%*%      - https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/pull/105.diff
inherits - https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/pull/106.diff
Ops      - https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/pull/107.diff
@        - https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/pull/108.diff

The repository for the S7 package can be found here:
https://github.com/RConsortium/OOP-WG

Your feedback is important to us, and we would be grateful for your
input on these patches. We aim to ensure that S7 is a high-quality
package that benefits the R community, while being mindful of not
disrupting existing projects or introducing breaking changes. If you
have any concerns or objections, please let us know. Your insights and
suggestions will be instrumental in shaping the final version of these
patches, and we appreciate your help in this process.

Thank you for your attention and contributions.

Best regards,
Tomasz
On behalf of the R Consortium OOP Working Group
