Dear Srinidhi,

You are trying to fit 1 random intercept and 2 random slopes per
individual, while you have at most 3 observations per individual. You
simply don't have enough data to fit the random slopes. Reduce the random
part to (1|ID).

Best regards,

I am running a multilevel growth curve model to examine predictors of
social anhedonia (SA) trajectory through ages 12, 15 and 18. SA is a
continuous numeric variable. The age variable (Index1) has been coded as 0
for age 12, 1 for age 15 and 2 for age 18. I am currently using a time
varying predictor, stress (LSI), which was measured at ages 12, 15 and 18,
to examine whether trajectory/variation in LSI predicts difference in SA
trajectory. LSI is a continuous numeric variable and was grand-mean
centered before using in the models. The data has been converted to long
format with SA in 1 column, LSI in the other, ID in another, and age in
another column. I used the code below to run my model using lmer. However,
I get the following error. Please let me know how I can solve this error.
Please note that I have 50% missing data in SA at age 12.

I did test the within-person variance for the LSI variable and the

Subject: [Rd] R hang/bug with circular references and promises
Message-ID: <CAPLMX9EyfB7cLgu89WPT_RFeuC1BDPYcZ81jR2q1aaDPVtnkEw@mail.gmail.com>

The following code snippet causes R to hang. This example might be a
bit contrived as I was experimenting and trying to understand
promises, but uses only base R.

It looks like it is looking for "not_a_variable" recursively but since
it doesn't exist it goes on indefinitely.

x0 <- new.env()
x1 <- new.env(parent = x0)
parent.env(x0) <- x1
delayedAssign("v", not_a_variable, eval.env=x1)
delayedAssign("w", v, assign.env=x1, eval.env=x0)
x1$w

This has nothing to do with promises. You created a cycle in the
environment chain. A simpler variant:

e <- new.env()
parent.env(e) <- e
get("x", e)

This will hang and is not interruptable -- loops searching up
environment chains are too speed-critical to check for interrupts.  It
is, however, pretty easy to check whether the parent change would
create a cycle and throw an error if it would. Need to think a bit
about exactly where the check should go.

Best,

FWIW, the help for parent.env already explicitly warns against using
parent.env <-:

The replacement function ?parent.env<-? is extremely dangerous as
     it can be used to destructively change environments in ways that
     violate assumptions made by the internal C code.  It may be
     removed in the near future.

Subject: [Rd] Change between 86152 and 86534 - probably 86265 - that looks
 for zspmv in BLAS and not LAPACK causes R with OpenBLAS to fail
Message-ID: <CAL6gwn+ZiPo7hUcJ5v99Y3AeTkSv+4o_yNa=h-A-qjjze2yNwA@mail.gmail.com>

Executive summary:

I believe revision 86265 makes it more difficult to build R with
OpenBLAS on Windows as now the entire LAPACK needs to be built to
obtain zspmv. Is there anything that can be done to allow the former
behavior to be used, something in Mkrules.local perhaps?

Detailed Explanation:

I have been building R with OpenBLAS for Windows 64 for over a decade
by patching /src/extra/blas/Makevars.win as follows:

--- /c/r/trunk/src/extra/blas/Makefile.win    2024-01-24
18:34:42.755255900 +0000
+++ /c/r/Makefile.win    2024-01-24 18:39:39.716458000 +0000
@@ -12,7 +12,7 @@
 ../../../$(BINDIR)/Rblas.dll: blas00.o ../../gnuwin32/dllversion.o
     @$(ECHO) -------- Building $@ --------
     $(DLL) -s -shared $(DLLFLAGS) -o $@ $^ Rblas.def \
-       -L../../../$(IMPDIR) -lR  -L"$(ATLAS_PATH)" -lf77blas -latlas

 else
 ../../../$(BINDIR)/Rblas.dll: blas.o blas2.o cmplxblas.o cmplxblas2.o
../../gnuwin32/dllversion.o
     @$(ECHO) -------- Building $@ --------

and then passing USE_ATLAS = YES and ATLAS_PATH = C:/R/OPB/whatever in
Mkrules.local

When I compile OpenBLAS, I have always done so with NO_CBLAS,
NO_LAPACK, and NO_SHARED, as the Windows toolchain does not need
CBLAS, a shared library, or allow for a separate LAPACK and this has
worked, for the most part, since roughly 2013.
When building the recent R-devel (a revision slightly before 86534),
the compilation stopped when building Rblas with the following error:

-------- Building ../../../bin/x64/Rblas.dll --------
gcc  -s -shared  -o ../../../bin/x64/Rblas.dll blas00.o
../../gnuwin32/dllversion.o Rblas.def \

make[2]: *** [Makefile:116: rbuild] Error 2
make[1]: *** [Makefile:17: all] Error 2
make: *** [Makefile:392: distribution] Error 2

I reached out to OpenBLAS (there were other issues with OPB 0.3.27)
and one of the maintainers responded:

> "for historical reasons, ZSPMV is in LAPACK although conceptionally [sic] it belongs in BLAS. As you specified NO_LAPACK=1, this function gets omitted since 0.3.20 to allow combining the BLAS-only build with an external LAPACK." [1]

He later followed up with "0.3.26 built with NO_LAPACK=1 will likewise
omit the zspmv symbol (as directed)." [2]

I last successfully compiled v86152 with OpenBLAS 0.3.26 on
2024-03-19. When I compiled 86534 tonight with OPB 0.3.27, I got the
error above. I then tried with OPB 0.3.26?which worked for 86152?and
still got the zspmv error.

I am guessing this relates to revision 86265 "amending r85873: zspmv
is BLAS, not Lapack?" [3].

I built OpenBLAS AND its LAPACK, which takes MUCH MUCH longer, and
tried building R. This time, the build succeeded and passes make
check-devel.

Is there any way to allow the former functionality if the build
recognizes the use of OpenBLAS? Is the only option to compile
OpenBLAS's LAPACK too?

Thank you,

Avi

Looks like I added that warning 22 years ago, so that should be enough
notice :-). I'll look into removing it now.

Dear Luke,

I've got a somewhat niche use case: as a way of protecting myself
against rogue *.rds files and vulnerabilities in the C code, I've been
manually unserializing "plain" data objects (without anything
executable), including environments, in R [1].

I see that SET_ENCLOS() is already commented as "not API and probably
should not be <...> used". Do you think there is a way to recreate an
environment, taking the REFSXP entries into account, without
`parent.env<-`?  Would you recommend to abandon the folly of
unserializing environments manually?

Best regards,
Ivan

For now I have just changed the internal code to throw an error
if the change would produce a cycle (r86545). This gives

     > e <- new.env()
     > parent.env(e) <- e
     Error in `parent.env<-`(`*tmp*`, value = <environment>) :
       cycles in parent chains are not allowed

I would try using two passes: create the environments in the first pass
and in a second pass, either over the file or a new object with place holders, fill them in.

SET_ENCLOS is one of a number of SET... functions that are not in the
API and should not be since they are potentially unsafe to use. (One
that is in the API and needs to be removed is SET_TYPEOF). So we would
like to move them out of installed headers and not export them as
entry points. For this particular case most uses I see are something
like

     env = allocSExp(ENVSXP);
     SET_FRAME(env, R_NilValue);
     SET_ENCLOS(env, parent);
     SET_HASHTAB(env, R_NilValue);
     SET_ATTRIB(env, R_NilValue);

which could just use

      env = R_NewEnv(parent, FALSE, 0);

Best,

luke

Thank you, but, well... for such small changes -- that would be
quite a bit of (human, i.e. R-core) overhead, but of course is
generally a good possibility  (but here, wait! .. and read on : )

Actually -- this now gets more  "R-devel" - appropriate --
I notice that there are quite a few  error("..." .. )
and also  warning("..." ..) calls in
src/main/altclasses.c *and* in
src/main/altrep.c        and *none* of them asks for translation;

While this could be for historical reasons (code originally much
by Gabe Becker from outside R-core *and* at first just in a
separate branch before being merged in to the main (r-devel)
branch.
OTOH: There may be good reasons for translations lookup being
brittle in case of altrep error messages .. and hence left off
purposely?

Thanks again Duncan and Ivan,

I forward then the email to R-devel.

Summarizing, the dataedit options (in RGui preferences or RConsole) to
colouring the View output do not have effect on the background of the row
and column names (see https://ibb.co/Dkn2pVs).

Could this be implemented?

Thank you!

Best regards,
Iago

This is entirely correct: the dialog uses the colour returned by
dialog_bg(), which is GetSysColor(COLOR_BTNFACE).

I think it could be a reasonable feature request to use an adjustable
colour for the row and column headers.

This seems like something that should be fairly easily doable.  Why 
don't you work out a patch?

Some decisions to make:

- What colours are we talking about?  Would you want the labels to have 
their colour set independent of the dialog colours?  If so, would you 
also want to configure the dialog colours?

- What names should be used for the colours?

- Where should all of these definitions be documented?

If you don't feel comfortable with the coding, perhaps you could answer 
these questions, and someone else may code it for you.  I won't (I no 
longer have easy access to Windows), but I could help with the design.

Hello
On the other hand, i find that R_compact_intrange checks whether (r = n2 -
n1 + 1) >= R_XLEN_T_MAX,  while seq_colon checks for (r = fabs(n2 - n1)) >=
R_XLEN_T_MAX. And only then n is defined as r + 1 + epsilon. r is not used
again
That is why seq_colon does not reject that size at first and then altrep
does.
Should not line 101  be  " if (r + 1 + FLT_EPSILON >= R_XLEN_T_MAX) "
instead of r >= R_XLEN_T_MAX?

Subject: [Rd] Support for as(x, "raw")
Message-ID: <c8868feb-ac25-4b69-8690-13c7db964ffa@gmail.com>

Hi,

as(x, "<vector-type>") is supported and does as.<vector-type>(x) for all 
vector types except for raw. For example all the following coercions 
work and do what you'd expect: as(1L, "logical"), as(1L, "double"), 
as(1L, "complex"), as(1L, "character"), as(1L, "list"). But as(1L, 
"raw") does not:

 ??? > as(1L, "raw")
 ??? Error in as(1L, "raw") :
 ? ? ? no method or default for coercing ?integer? to ?raw?

Even though as.raw(1L) works:

 ??? > as.raw(1L)
 ??? [1] 01

Is there any particular reason for that or would it be reasonable to 
define a coerce() method from ANY to raw like it's been done for all the 
other vector types:

 ??? > selectMethod(coerce, c("ANY", "logical"))
 ??? Method Definition:
 ??? function (from, to, strict = TRUE)
 ??? {
 ? ? ? ? value <- as.logical(from)
 ? ? ? ? if (strict)
 ?? ? ?? ??? attributes(value) <- NULL
 ? ? ? ? value
 ??? }
 ??? <environment: namespace:methods>
 ??? Signatures:
 ??? ? ?? ?? from? to
 ??? target? "ANY" "logical"
 ??? defined "ANY" "logical"

 ??? ...

 ??? ...

 ??? > selectMethod(coerce, c("ANY", "list"))
 ??? Method Definition:
 ??? function (from, to, strict = TRUE)
 ??? {
 ? ? ? ? value <- as.list(from)
 ?? ? ?? if (strict)
 ?? ? ?? ??? attributes(value) <- NULL
 ? ? ? ? value
 ??? }
 ??? <environment: namespace:methods>
 ??? Signatures:
 ? ? ? ????? from? to
 ??? target? "ANY" "list"
 ??? defined "ANY" "list"


 ??? > selectMethod(coerce, c("ANY", "raw"))
 ??? Error in selectMethod(coerce, c("ANY", "raw")) :
 ? ? ? no method found for signature ANY, raw

About the decisions:

Actually, the same way dataedittext modifies the text colour not only
of data, but also of row and column names, and dataedituser modifies
the colour of all the borders, I think dataeditbg should modify the
background of all the window, at least that "inside" those
borders. Otherwise, any other option for the background colour on row
and column headers would allow the same set of colours and with the
same names, which are those commented in Rconsole:

## Colours for console and pager(s)
# (see rwxxxx/etc/rgb.txt for the known colours).

Regarding the code, looking to the Windows data editor [1], and taking
into account what you and lastly Ivan told previously

    This is entirely correct: the dialog uses the colour returned by
    dialog_bg(), which is GetSysColor(COLOR_BTNFACE).

(maybe a naive question from who does not know the code), could not be
used `guiColors[dataeditbg]` instead of `dialog_bg()` in the unique
place this is present?. So, instead of

    bbg = dialog_bg()

it would appear

    bbg = guiColors[dataeditbg];


Thanks!

Tema: Re: FR: Customize background colour of row and column headers for the View output

This seems like something that should be fairly easily doable.  Why
don't you work out a patch?

Some decisions to make:

- What colours are we talking about?  Would you want the labels to have
their colour set independent of the dialog colours?  If so, would you
also want to configure the dialog colours?

- What names should be used for the colours?

- Where should all of these definitions be documented?

If you don't feel comfortable with the coding, perhaps you could answer
these questions, and someone else may code it for you.  I won't (I no
longer have easy access to Windows), but I could help with the design.

A criticism of your suggestion is that it is not backwards compatible. 
Does that matter?  I don't know, but probably not.  The X11 version of 
the viewer does what you suggest.

The change suggested by Iago Gin? V?zquez is indeed very simple. It
sets the background colour of the row and column headers to the
background of the rest of the dataentry window. With this patch, R
passes 'make check'. As Duncan Murdoch mentions, the X11 editor already
behaves this way.

If it's not acceptable to make the row and column headers the same
colour as the rest of the text, let's make it into a separate setting.

Hello,

 

The US Air Force used to have R available on our main network, but now those who need to accept it back are
being very particular about what they're accepting in terms of official documentation.

 

Would you be able to help me with this endeavor?  I'm attaching a pdf that shows what documentation they'd
require for us to re-establish R as being acceptable on the network here.  I understand if you're too busy or
if it's a pain.  Haha

 

Thank you so much for your help and consideration!

Hey Doug,

R is not a product that is provided by a company or any vendor that can be
procured through a vendor e.g. something on a GSA schedule.

Seems like you're caught in the bureaucracy hell hole. I used to help the
USAF, and other DoD members use R when I was at RStudio (now Posit).

I recommend you find someone in your organization who is doing Data
Science. They'll likely have charted a path and you can follow in their
footsteps.
For example https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshua-couse/.

Jeremy Allen has since taken over my role at Posit since I've left. I'm
sure he knows a plethora of people in the USAF who are using R and can help
you out.

You described it well; I?m afraid that?s what it is.  They want documents of an organization that doesn?t fit the description, and only then will they test it.

 

That sounds great.  I?ll reach out to Jeremy and see if he can help me get the IDs the USAF wants.  It sounds like Joshua predates my time here.  That?s a really good idea.

 

Thanks very much!

 

Doug

   For what it's worth

https://www.r-project.org/foundation/board.html

  says

The R Foundation is seated in Vienna, Austria and currently hosted by 
the Vienna University of Economics and Business. It is a registered 
association under Austrian law and active worldwide. The R Foundation 
can be contacted by e-mail to R-foundation at r-project.org


   The statutes here <https://www.r-project.org/foundation/> probably 
won't be useful, but you might be able to get the Austrian registration 
documents from someone at the R foundation (see e-mail above); it seems 
as though that might qualify for lists A and B in your documentation 
specs, and they might be able to provide you with an Austrian tax 
receipt for list C ...

Years ago, there was a commercialized version of R from Revolution. It was bought by Microsoft, and turned into Microsoft R. Their version of CRAN was called MRAN. It's discontinued I believe, but the last Microsoft R version was already on the 4.0 major version.

Hello,



The US Air Force used to have R available on our main network, but now those who need to accept it back are
being very particular about what they're accepting in terms of official documentation.



Would you be able to help me with this endeavor?  I'm attaching a pdf that shows what documentation they'd
require for us to re-establish R as being acceptable on the network here.  I understand if you're too busy or

 that's not strictly true though is it? Anyone can form a company and
supply R, as long as everyone complies with the license. You are also free
to download R from public services and do it without any corporate
wrappings and trappings, which is what Posit (ex-RStudio) do, right?

I don't see anything in the PDF posted that links the software to the
company details required. Does it have to be the copyright holder of the
software? Or anyone free to distribute it by license? Does the USAF use
other open source systems, eg Linux, in which case are they going through a
licensed reseller to tick these boxes?

Hi,

I am seeing this on Linux as well as MacOS: Opening any output pipe from R 4.4.0 to TTY programs like "less"/"more" hangs, SIGINT-proof:
> $ R/4.4.0/bin/Rscript -e 'pipe("less", "w")'
> $ R/4.4.0/bin/Rscript -e 'cat("test", file="|less")
> $ R/4.4.0/bin/Rscript -e 'cat("test", file="|more")

R 4.3.3 and earlier have been working fine:
> $ R/4.3.3/bin/Rscript -e 'pipe("less", "w")'
> $ R/4.3.3/bin/Rscript -e 'cat("test", file="|less")
> $ R/4.3.3/bin/Rscript -e 'cat("test", file="|more")


R 4.4.0 also works fine with non-TTY output pipes:
> $ R/4.4.0/bin/Rscript -e 'pipe("cat", "w")'

> $ R/4.4.0/bin/Rscript -e 'cat("test", file="|cat")
> $ R/4.4.0/bin/Rscript -e 'cat("Hi!\n", file="|tr i o")'
> $ R/4.4.0/bin/Rscript -e 'cat("Hi!\n", file="|sed -e s/i/o/")'

For what it's worth, input pipes from less/more to R 4.4.0 do not hang, but are not always the same as before either. These are the same:
> $ R/4.3.3/bin/Rscript -e 'con <- pipe("less --version", "r"); readLines(con); close(con)'
> [1] "less (GNU regular expressions)" "Copyright (C) Mark Nudelman" ...
> $ R/4.4.0/bin/Rscript -e 'con <- pipe("less --version", "r"); readLines(con); close(con)'
> [1] "less (GNU regular expressions)" "Copyright (C) Mark Nudelman" ...
But these are not (again, on both Linux and MacOS):

> [1] "Missing filename (\"less --help\" for help)"

I did not see anything related here or in release notes or bugzilla. Is this a bug or something else?

Message-ID: <7d2fba0d-6abb-4df0-b388-e82280a8bac1@gmail.com>

I've just upgraded to an M3 Mac laptop, and I'm working through getting 
the right configure settings to build R.

The Installation and Administration manual says to have this in config.site:

FFLAGS="-g -O2 -mmacos-version-min=11.0"
FCFLAGS="-g -O2 -mmacos-version-min=11.0"

but those give an error on my system, with it suggesting the FFLAGS and 
FCFLAGS version option should be -mmacosx-version-min=11.0.  I don't 
know if that's a typo or a change.

I've tried the first example and it doesn't work for me even in R 4.3.3 
on Linux, so I can't easily test what changed the behavior for you, but 
it was very likely a bugfix for PR#17764. Now the pipe() uses a special 
process group to protect the processes (assumed to be background) from 
the terminal.

If you are interested in the details behind this, see the bug report 
discussion or the blog post (below), and the source code.

A perhaps slightly over-simplified description is that tasks executed 
via pipe() and (file="|") and system(wait="FALSE") are background tasks, 
which should not be interruptible e.g. by Ctrl+C. This was fixed in R 
4.4, which required significant changes of the underlying implementation.

To support the very rare case when a task executed via 
system(wait="FALSE") should receive signals from a console, because it 
is to logically implement an interactive task using background tasks, 
there is now an argument "receive.console.signals", which can be used to 
override this. This is used by the R's parallel package to implement 
interactive computation on a cluster.

Your use case seems to be running an interactive task using pipe(). 
Currently, there is no argument of pipe() to allow this as we didn't 
anticipate anyone would actually be doing this - and, on my system, it 
doesn't work even in R 4.3.3.

I assume the examples above are narrowed down cases to reproduce the 
change in behavior. If there was a plausible, realistic example that 
would indicate the need to add such argument to pipe(), it could be 
considered, but perhaps it would be more natural to use 
system(wait=FALSE,receive.console.signals=TRUE), anyway?

Best

-mmacos-version-min= is the current Apple option.  However, the gfortran 
build recommended in the manual is quite old and this has apparently 
differed by GCC version (and is not documented in the 'man gfortran' I 
have).

I'll change the manual to mention both forms, and that it is only 
sometimes needed (not on my current setup).

Thank you, that makes sense. Not worth messing with those changes on my account, but since you asked, my actual use case was for an R script (or rather my package used by one) to display text (e.g. for --help) using the system PAGER, without writing temporary files for file.show() because modifying the file system just to show some help text doesn't seem right. No worries, easy enough for me to add a text.show() or general pipecat() in C, though cat(x, file="|less") did use to just work fine, too. Thanks again for clearing this up.

Subject: [Rd] confint Attempts to Use All Server CPUs by Default
Message-ID: <SY2PR01MB3003B98D67B632CB7EF7498CCDEA2@SY2PR01MB3003.ausprd01.prod.outlook.com>

Hello,

Would a less resource-intensive value, such as 1, be a safer default CPU value for confint? I noticed excessive CPU usage on a I.T. administrator-managed server which was being three-quarters used by another staff member when the confidence interval calculation in an R Markdown document suddenly changed from two seconds to ninety seconds because of competition for CPUs between users. Also, there is no mention of such parallel processing in ?confint, so it was not clear at first where to look for performance degradation. It could at least be described in the manual page so that users would know that export OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 is a solution.

Which confint() method do you have in mind? There is at least four of
them by default in R, and many additional classes could make use of
stats:::confint.default by implementing vcov().

There isn't much R can do about the behaviour of the BLAS, because
there is no standard interface to set the number of threads. Some BLASes
(like ATLAS) don't even offer it as a tunable number at all [*].

A system administrator could link the installation of R against
FlexiBLAS [**], provide safe defaults in the environment variables and
educate the users about its tunables [***], but that's a choice just
like it had been a choice to link R against a parallel variant of
OpenBLAS on a shared computer. This is described in R Installation and
Administration, section A.3.1 [****].

   Following up on this -- on my system, I have 69 packages installed 
that appear to provide something like a confint() method:

h <-  help.search("confint", agrep = FALSE)
p <- sort(unique(h$matches$Package))
length(p)
## [1] 69

p

  [1] "bamlss"          "bbmle"           "binom"           "brglm2" 

  [5] "broom"           "caper"           "car"             "CDM" 

  [9] "CLME"            "coin"            "crosstable"      "dclone" 

[13] "doBy"            "drc"             "Ecfun"           "emmeans"
[17] "epigrowthfit"    "evd"             "Exact"           "fitode"
[21] "fixest"          "ggfortify"       "ggplot2"         "GLMMadaptive"
[25] "glmmTMB"         "gratia"          "hdm"             "JMbayes"
[29] "JointAI"         "lava"            "lme4"            "lmeresampler"
[33] "lmtest"          "logistf"         "MASS"            "maxLik"
[37] "metafor"         "mitml"           "MKmisc"          "mmrm"
[41] "mosaic"          "MplusAutomation" "multcomp"        "ordinal"
[45] "papaja"          "parsnip"         "prodlim"         "R2admb"
[49] "rethinking"      "riskRegression"  "RSA"             "rstanarm"
[53] "rxode2"          "segmented"       "simr"            "sirt"
[57] "sn"              "spaMM"           "stats"           "stats4"

[65] "TMB"             "unmarked"        "vegan"           "VGAM"
[69] "zipfR"

  If a confint() method were actually included in the package test 
suite, I would expect this kind of problem to be caught by CRAN checks 
(which look for code that is being greedy with parallelization). But 
it's perfectly possible that a package maintainer neglected to include 
such tests ...

Hello,

It is from the stats package and applied to the output of logistic regression as implemented by glm with setting family = "binomial". So, it is a base package and not an add-on CRAN package. I shall recommend linking to FlexiBLAS to our system administrator.
