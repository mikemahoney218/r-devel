Subject: [Rd] static html vignette
Message-ID: <CAJ=0CtCZM4AW_obdmipvd_X9pcF_b2JD49qbbNVpX+Z9VnZwGg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

I learned how to include a static pdf vignette into an R package, using a
dummy .Rnw file to include an already produced "vignette.pdf" file:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{pdfpages}
\begin{document}
\includepdf[pages=-, fitpaper=true]{vignette.pdf}
\end{document}

I wonder if it would be possible to include an html static vignette. Such
Rmarkdown (to html) vignettes can be produced using package "knitr", which
users are forced to install (along with dozens of knitr-dependent packages
from tidyverse) despite having nothing to do with the package itself.

If at all possible, I would like to avoid having users install "knitr" via
the Suggests field. I love that package, but I don't like its dependency
chain.

Thank you for any suggestions,
Adrian

This is better suited for R-package-devel, not R-devel.

I would say that static vignettes are against the spirit of vignettes:
the idea is to provide another layer of unit testing to the package by
providing a deeper executable example than is possible with just Rd
examples. I think that Bioconductor will even refuse a package with a
vignette with no executable code in it.

Still, you can use the R.rsp package to provide static vignettes in
both PDF and HTML formats:
https://cran.r-project.org/package=R.rsp/vignettes/R_packages-Static_PDF_and_HTML_vignettes.pdf

This will add 6 packages to your total Suggests budget:

setdiff(
 unlist(package_dependencies('R.rsp', recursive=TRUE)),
 unlist(standard_package_names())
)
# [1] "R.methodsS3" "R.oo"        "R.utils"     "R.cache"     "digest"  

HTML vignettes currently have much better accessibility than PDF
vignettes, and the need for a low-dependency-footprint (in terms of
both R packages and external tools like Pandoc) HTML vignette engine is
evident <https://github.com/rstats-gsod/gsod2022/issues/5>. It's easy
to solve this problem ~80% of the way, but making something that ticks
all the boxes (zero-dependency and/or suitable for inclusion into R
itself, handles plots *and* math, low-boilerplate, no external
dependencies like Pandoc or JavaScript CDNs, compact output) is a hard
problem that's mostly not fun to work on.

The R2HTML package has no non-core hard dependencies and provides an
HTML Sweave engine, but I'm not sure it can be used in a vignette (and
it probably needs more maintainer work to be up to modern standards).

The zero-dependency approach will be to bring your own vignette engine
with you, but that requires lots of additional work (including bug
workarounds: <https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18191>). I've
seen CRAN packages that do that, but I cannot find them right now. Yet
another trick would be to provide a dummy *.Rnw file to trigger the
vignette-building code and a Makefile in which the real vignette is
produced (removing the dummy vignette and its intermediate output).
Again, writing a portable Makefile is non-trivial and only lets you
work around PR18191.

Message-ID: <CAFDcVCSYSQ4zWvGuUdZ0PGC7C50GaRJtfAwqTq172vq30fEnQQ@mail.gmail.com>

ISSUE:

On MS Windows, running cmd.exe, calling

Rscript --vanilla -e "port <- tools::startDynamicHelp(); port; port <-
tools::startDynamicHelp(FALSE); port"

will sometimes stall R at the end, preventing it from existing.  This
also happens when running R in interactive mode.  It seems to stem
from calling tools::startDynamicHelp(FALSE).

Before filing a formal bug report, can someone please confirm this
behavior? You might have to call it multiple times to hit the bug.

Thank you for confirming this. I just filed PR#18650
(https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18650).

FWIW, I've found two other issues with startDynamicHelp() prior to this:

I was able to reproduce this both with Rscript and interactively using the same version of R you're using (fresh install) and Windows 10.0.22621.2715. It took about a dozen tries.

I had previously asked about R interfaces to various "other" visualization

various codes. I was working on this,

https://github.com/mmarchywka/mjmdatascope

but in the meantime found out that Paraview has an "in-situ"
capability for similar objectives. 

https://discourse.paraview.org/t/does-or-can-paraview-support-streaming-input/13637/9

While R does have a lot of plotting features, 
it seems like an excellent tool to interface to R allowing visualization without
a bunch of temp files or 

Is anyone aware of anyone doing this interface or reasons its  a boondoggle?

Thanks.

This sounds like it's better suited for r-package-devel at r-project.org,
not R-devel itself.

In theory, nothing should prevent you from writing C++ code interfacing
with ParaView (via its "adios" streaming library) and with R. The Rcpp
package will likely help you bring the semantics of the two languages
closer together. (Memory allocation and error handling are the two
major topics where R and C++ especially disagree.)

On the R side, make an object with reference semantics (i.e. an
external pointer) and use callbacks to update it with new information
while R code is running. On the R extension side, translate these
callbacks into necessary calls to the adios library to transfer the
data to ParaView.

For more informaion, see Writing R Extensions at
<https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html> and Rcpp
documentation at <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rcpp>.

Subject: [Rd] Sys.which() caching path to `which`
Message-ID: <20240110224331.24ee0edf@Tarkus>

Hello R-devel,

Currently on Unix-like systems, Sys.which incorporates the absolute
path to the `which` executable, obtained at the configure stage:

>    ## hopefully configure found [/usr]/bin/which
>    which <- "@WHICH@"
>    if (!nzchar(which)) {
>        warning("'which' was not found on this platform")

This poses a problem for the Spack package manager and software
distribution. In Spack, like in Nix, Guix, and GoboLinux, packages live
under their own path prefixes, which look like the following:

>> /opt/spack/opt/spack/linux-ubuntu18.04-x86_64_v3/gcc-7.5.0/r-4.3.0-eqteloqhjzix6ta373ruzt5imvvbcesc

Unfortunately, Spack packages are expected to get relocated, changing
the path prefix and invalidating stored paths, including the path to
`which`: <https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/41953>.

Harmen Stoppels, who is not subscribed to R-devel but interested in
making R work in Spack, currently creates a symlink to `which`
<https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/pull/151> as part of a patch to R.

What would be the minimally disruptive way to avoid this dependency or
at least make it easier to fix post-factum, during relocation? What
would be the pitfall if Sys.which() were to find `which` on the $PATH
by itself, without remembering the full path?

At ORNL, we worked with VisIt (a sibling of Paraview, both funded largely by DOE) around 2016 and made an in situ demo with R. We used packages pbdMPI (on CRAN) and pbdDMAT (on GitHub/RbigData), which were in part built for this purpose. Later also the package hola (on GitHub/RbigData) was built to connect with adios2, which can do buffered in situ connections with various codes.

But the VisIt developers were not interested in R (preferring to roll their own), so that direction fizzled. Paraview is a competetive sibling of VisIt, so I don?t know if they would be interested. The packages we developed are viable for that purpose. There is a lot in R that could benefit Paraview (or VisIt).

Ivan,

I suspect that the `which' case is just the tip of the iceberg - generally, R expects all tools it detects at configure time to be callable, just to list a few from a running session:

PAGER                   /usr/bin/less
R_BROWSER               /usr/bin/open
R_BZIPCMD               /usr/bin/bzip2
R_GZIPCMD               /usr/bin/gzip
R_PDFVIEWER             /usr/bin/open
R_QPDF                  /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/qpdf
R_TEXI2DVICMD           /usr/local/bin/texi2dvi
R_UNZIPCMD              /usr/bin/unzip
R_ZIPCMD                /usr/bin/zip
SED                     /usr/bin/sed
TAR                     /usr/bin/tar

I would claim it is not an unreasonable expectation that the user doesn't delete tools after R was built. Obviously it is tedious, but Spack may need to patch all absolute paths if it wants to relocate things (it's not easy as it includes all linker paths as well FWIW) - they must be doing something like that already as even the R start-up script uses absolute paths:

$ grep ^R_ /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/R 
R_HOME_DIR=/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources
R_HOME="${R_HOME_DIR}"
R_SHARE_DIR=/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/share
R_INCLUDE_DIR=/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/include
R_DOC_DIR=/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/doc
R_binary="${R_HOME}/bin/exec${R_ARCH}/R"

That said, WHICH is a mess - it may make sense to switch to the command -v built-in which is part of POSIX (where available - which is almost everywhere today) which would not require an external tool, but as noted I don't think this is the only problem Spack has... (and that's just core R - even a bigger can of worms with R packages :P).

Cheers,
Simon

Harmen,

thanks for the additional details, it wasn't exactly clear what this is about. Ivan's post didn't mention that the issue here is the caching, not the path replacement which you are apparently already doing, now it makes more sense.

I still think it is dangerous as you have no way of knowing who else is caching values at installation time since there is no reason to assume that the system will change after installation - technically, it breaks the contract with the application. We are trying to get packages to not hard-code or cache paths, but that typically only applies to the package library location, not to system tools.

Cheers,
Simon

Obviously it is tedious, but Spack may need to patch all absolute paths if it wants to relocate things (it's not easy as it includes all linker paths as well FWIW) - they must be doing something like that already as even the R start-up script uses absolute paths

Thanks Aidan and Ivan,

I agree these conflicts can be solved when spotted. And certainly more easily
so if there were a dedicated currying syntax in base R as Ivan mentioned.
However I think both users and package authors would benefit from being able
to prevent the collisions altogether.

To collect some data on the prevalence, I analyzed the 387 installed packages
on my machine, including 23 433 functions. Of those, 2 585 (11%) both accepted
... and had a "mangled" first argument name (one that did not start with a
lower case letter), indicating that the function might have benefited from
the availability of a positional-only parameter syntax.

Thanks, Ivan, for the pointers. Following them I was able to put together a...
let's say proof of concept patch for this, included below. With the patch[1]
we indeed have for example:

g <- function(x, f, /, ...) match.call()
g(1, f, x = 2) == quote(g(1, f, x = 2))

Or:

my_lapply <- function(x, f, /, ...) {
  res <- vector("list", length(x))
  for (i in seq_along(x)) {
    res[[i]] <- f(x[[i]], ...)
  }
  res
}

add <- function(x, y) x + y
my_lapply(1:5, add, x = 1)

Best wishes,

Mikko
