Message-ID: <emcfa70b95-004c-45fb-8936-55133f137688@dell>

Writing Extensions for R under Windows: is it better for GUIs to 
communicate with R via Rgui.exe, Rterm.exe or R.dll?

In the construction of extensions (GUIs) for R, in the establishment of 
communication, according to the options below:

1- Rgui.exe (via Windows API) vs. R.dll (embedded R)
2- Rterm.exe (via IPC) vs. R.dll (embedded R)

What are the advantages and disadvantages in each case?

I would like to take advantage of the email to thank Tomas Kalibera for 
his efforts in solving the problems
of R 4.2.0 communication and the Tinn-R project. Once fixed the issues 
in R that surfaced
due to using GraphApp (cross-platform GUI Library in C for Windows) it 
was possible to fix the communication issues in Tinn-R
with Rterm.exe and Rgui.exe. Version 9.01.XX.XX with the corrections 
will be released soon. At the moment we are in
extensive testing phase.

Thanks in advance,

Subject: [Rd] trace() an S3-classed function in .GlobalEnv
Message-ID: <CAPRVBcwOh0zst8mGTCfYXK6OXdGViGHUOiV5A8NhV4Lh6eo2gQ@mail.gmail.com>

Consider:

foo <- function() {
  invisible(1 + 1)
}
trace(foo, quote(message("traced")), print=FALSE)
foo()
# traced

But with a minimal change:

class(foo) <- "bar"
trace(foo, quote(message("traced")), print=FALSE)
# Constructing traceable class ?barWithTrace?
# Error in .classEnv(className) :
#   unable to find an environment containing class ?bar?

I don't see anything like this mentioned in ?trace (nor does a Google
search turn up more than a handful of references to this error),
and from trying to debug what trace() is doing, we arrive to the error line[1]:

.makeTraceClass(traceClass, class(original))  #
methods:::.makeTraceClass("barWithTrace", "bar")

I don't quite follow what's going on here, but it looks like trace()
is trying to determine an S4 class definition for "bar", but isS4(bar)
is FALSE.

I can (apparently -- not sure if there are as yet-unseen downstream
consequences) work around the issue by unsetting the class, tracing,
then re-setting:

class(foo) <- NULL
trace(foo, quote(message("traced")), print=FALSE)
class(foo) <- "bar"

But obviously this is a bit clunky. Is this a bug, or am I missing something?

Subject: [Rd] R CMD Check should allow packages with C and C++ and OpenMP
 without generating a NOTE
Message-ID: <CAOsNuxCte7DOu5kBjH44CxeJnR=bHr7DVAZZk=rQ9M_J5502qA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Developers,

I have the following issue with my package collapse:
https://github.com/SebKrantz/collapse,
whose code base is 34.5% C code and 28.3% C++, and to which I now want to
add OpenMP multithreading and send it to CRAN. For this I have set up a
Makevars file with

PKG_CFLAGS = $(SHLIB_OPENMP_CFLAGS)
PKG_CXXFLAGS = $(SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS)
PKG_LIBS = $(SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS)

as linking is through C++ via Rcpp. The problem is that this generates a
NOTE on R CMD Check:

src/Makevars: SHLIB_OPENMP_CFLAGS is included in PKG_CFLAGS but not in
PKG_LIBS

If I alternatively put

PKG_LIBS = $(SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS) $(SHLIB_OPENMP_CFLAGS)

I get another NOTE stating that this is not portable. Finally putting

PKG_LIBS = $(SHLIB_OPENMP_CFLAGS)

gives a note (or warning) that linking is through C++. CRAN maintainers
have not engaged constructively with me on the issue, but I do believe this
is an issue requiring constructive engagement i.e. I believe R CMD Check
should be adjusted to allow for such a configuration, and possibly some
instructions should be added to the Writing R Extensions Manual. I have
also asked Dirk Eddelbuettel (
https://github.com/SebKrantz/collapse/issues/258) who agrees that this is
an upstream issue. I am happy for any proactive comments or suggestions.

Best regards,

Sebastian Krantz

Just a short note of  semi-confirmation:

At the time S4 generics and methods were introduced into R,
trace() was made much more flexible, notably to be able to trace
S4 methods.

It can well be that it originally also worked for functions with
an explicit S3 class, but as such functions are very rare, it
could well be you've found a bug, namely that trace() assumes
that if a function has a non-trivial class, it must be an S4
one.

... and I know you know how to report bugs ;-)

Thank you in advance!
Martin

For the record: it seems a simple text-substitution approach in the
Makevars file solves the issue, e.g. to have a package combining C, C++ and
OpenMP, your Makevars file could look like this:

PKG_CFLAGS = $($(subst OPENMP,OPENMP_CFLAGS,SHLIB_OPENMP))
PKG_CXXFLAGS = $(SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS)
PKG_LIBS = $(SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS)

where $($(subst OPENMP,OPENMP_CFLAGS,SHLIB_OPENMP)) substitutes
OPENMP_CFLAGS for OPENMP, thus reconstructing SHLIB_OPENMP_CFLAGS and
avoiding errors from static code analysis on R CMD Check.

Needless to say this is not very elegant and it would be great if R CMD
Check could be adjusted.

Best regards,

Sebastian

Well, WRE section 8 is all about linking the GUI to R as a DLL. It does
mention the alternative approaches like Rserve or DCOM, but such
interfaces are limited to some extents.

Setting aside the fact that Windows API is not cross platform (which
may be not the point if you're writing a Windows-only GUI), the
messages that the application accepts and interprets are not a part of
a documented interface, so while they tend to be stable (because
Windows is mostly stable in handing the same kinds of messages to the
applications running there), they may be broken (like in R 4.2.0).

Linking to R.dll has a higher initial cost of setting up (you have to
write those callbacks, you have to set up R_HOME...), but the interface
won't be broken without a good reason and a migration plan.

> 2- Rterm.exe (via IPC) vs. R.dll (embedded R)

The console interface might be better understood and more stable than
passing messages to windows. If you're writing some kind of universal
interface suitable for different applications, all of which run a
Run-Eval-Print Loop in the command line, this may be a better approach
to take instead of linking to them individually. Although not without
problems [*], this is probably more stable than talking to Rgui.exe by
means of SendInput().

> What are the advantages and disadvantages in each case?

The advantages of linking to R.dll include being able to set up all
kinds of callbacks (EditFile, Busy, dataentry/dataviewer/selectlist) to
make their behaviour fit the theme of your application. The
disadvantages include a higher initial cost of setting it up and maybe
having to recompile it for different versions of R.

Best regards,
Ivan

[*] Check out ConEmu <https://conemu.github.io/> source code for
workarounds they probably amassed for all kinds of applications that
would otherwise prefer to be running in the standard console window.

Thanks, that seems like a reasonable assessment.

Also worth noting that tracing wipes out a function's attributes,
which is also not documented:

foo = function(x) {
  invisible(1 + 1)
}
attr(foo, "bar") <- 2

trace(foo, quote(message('traced')))
names(attributes(foo))
# [1] "original" "source"   "class"

PS one day I hope to master the dark art of choosing r-devel or
bugzilla for issues :)

Subject: [Rd] Behavior of ylim in boxplot() when horizontal=TRUE
Message-ID: <6677093c725645a68ee92cdf054fdf87@UM-MAIL3214.unimaas.nl>

Hi all,

I just noticed something when using boxplot(). Say we have this boxplot:

boxplot(mpg ~ cyl, data=mtcars, xlab="Cylinders", ylab="Miles per Galon", ylim=c(10,40), log="y")

ylab, ylim, and log="y" are all consistently adjusting things on the y-axis (the numeric 'outcome' variable).

Now let's use horizontal=TRUE:

boxplot(mpg ~ cyl, data=mtcars, las=1, xlab="Miles per Galon", ylab="Cylinders", horizontal=TRUE, ylim=c(10,40), log="x")

Now xlab and log="x" are used to adjust things on the x-axis, but ylim still needs to be used to adjust the range of the numeric 'outcome' variable. Not a big deal, but this seems a bit inconsistent.

Best,
Wolfgang
