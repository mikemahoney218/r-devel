 Error compiling 87283 on Windows 10 using Rtools4.4 6335-6327

For (temporary) closure. The error only manifests if OpenBLAS is built
with the setting "INTERFACE64=1" in Makefile.rule, whose explanation
is: "If you want to drive whole 64bit region by BLAS. Not all Fortran
# compilers support this. It's safe to keep this commented out if you
# are not sure. (This is equivalent to the "-i8" ifort option)."

When this setting is commented out, R compiles and passes check-devel.
Why setting this creates a segfault when byte-compiling grDevices is
well beyond my ken, but for now, so long as "INTERFACE64=1" is
commented out, R should compile with OpenBLAS completely as it has for
the past decade or two (adjusting for the recent change in
src/extra/blas/Makefile.win, of course)

Thank you, especially Tomas!

yes, of course!  (Note that till a few days ago, this was `list(...)[[1L]]` ..)

indeed, yes!

the current version of datetime.R  does not contain that any
more ..  and as you've noticed on Bugzilla,  we are still
tweaking the behaviour of  format.POSIXlt() ..

Thank you, very much, Suharto,
for the two small improvements above (committed as svn rev 87382) !!
