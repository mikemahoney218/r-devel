Subject: [Rd] unsplit() mangles attributes
Message-ID: <CAP=dwz_nERk37W4ybjO7R1Y+C+UTZ+pan+oZVyGDnYa861yZ=w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Unsplitting a named vector that's been split sets all the names as missing.

x <- 1:12
names(x) <- letters[x]
f <- gl(2, 6)

unsplit(split(x, f), f)
<NA> <NA> <NA> <NA> <NA> <NA> <NA> <NA> <NA> <NA> <NA> <NA>
   1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10   11   12

The unsplit() function correctly deals with row names when unsplitting
a split data frame, and the same approach preserves regular names as
well. Here's a stripped-down version of unsplit() that keeps names:

unsplit_with_names <- function(value, f) {
  len <- length(f)
  x <- value[[1L]][rep(NA_integer_, len)] # names get lost here...
  split(x, f) <- value
  has_names <- !is.null(names(value[[1L]]))
  if (has_names) {
    split(names(x), f) <- lapply(value, names) # so add them back here
  }
  x
}

unsplit_with_names(split(x, f), f)
 a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i  j  k  l
 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12

I plan on reporting this on bugzilla, with a more general fix, but
would first like to see if I'm missing anything, and check that my
reasoning is clear.

It seems that names are the only attribute for unclassed vectors that
survive the default method of split(), and so I think the above
version of unsplit() replaces all the attributes it can for unclassed
vectors.

I'm less confident about classed vectors, as unsplit() isn't generic
and potentially needs to deal with objects. Dates and factors work
fine, as it seems they can only lose names; this is addressed with the
above version of unsplit(). But are there other attributes for classed
objects that may get lost with unsplit? Can my fix above cause
problems for certain classes? (Note that I didn't use the recursion
that unsplit() uses for data frames, as that relies on names not
themselves having names.)

The real challenge is that unsplit need not have all the information
about the original object it's trying to put back together. Take the
case of a vector with a dim attribute.

y <- matrix(x, 3, 4, dimnames = list(letters[1:3], letters[1:4]))

unsplit(split(y, f), f)
[1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12

A possible solution is for split() to record the attributes of its
argument for later use by unsplit(). Again, consider some
stripped-down alternatives:

split_with_attr <- function(x, f) {
  res <- split(x, f)
  structure(res, original.attr = attributes(x))
}

unsplit_with_attr <- function(value, f) {
  len <- length(f)
  x <- value[[1L]][rep(NA_integer_, len)]
  split(x, f) <- value
  attributes(x) <- attr(value, "original.attr")
  x
}

unsplit_with_attr(split_with_attr(y, f), f)
  a b c  d
a 1 4 7 10
b 2 5 8 11
c 3 6 9 12

But this seems complicated, and may muck up existing code. It would be
much easier if I can just restrict attention to restoring lost names
for unclassed vectors :)

Any thoughts are much appreciated.

Thanks,
Steve

Subject: [Rd] as.Date without "origin"

The new (2022-10-11 r83083 ucrt) as.Date function returns a date rather than an error when called without "origin" specified.

# previous versions of R
as.Date(0)
# Error in as.Date.numeric(0) : 'origin' must be supplied

# new:
as.Date(0)
# [1] "1970-01-01"

This is at odds with the help file, which gives:

origin

aDateobject, or something which can be coerced byas.Date(origin, ...)to such an object.

And:
as.Datewill accept numeric data (the number of days since an epoch), butonlyiforiginis supplied.

The behavior described in the help file and implemented in previous versions seems more reasonable than returning a date with an arbitrary "origin". In any case, in the r-devel there is a mismatch between the function and its description.

I don't see a compelling rationale for changing the default behavior as.Date to deviate from the wholly reasonable status quo of "as.Date will accept numeric data (the number of days since an epoch), but only if origin is supplied." That has been the expectation for a long, long time. 

In any case, the manual should match the behavior.

This is in R-devel, mind you, i.e., unreleased and quite possibly unfinished work.

No released version of R does this. E.g.,

Of course. But the broken as.Date in R-devel breaks one of my packages, so I'm getting threats of the package being removed from CRAN in a few days if the breakage is not resolved.

Dear all,

I would throw in my vote to have origin = "1970-01-01" as a default in as.Date().  Why?  Well, in fact, the "converse" function as.numeric() does have an implicit default:

> as.numeric(Sys.Date())
[1] 19298

In fact, as.numeric seems to not even have a method for class "Date", and so as.numeric() does not even have an argument "origin" or the like.

In any case, when using Date objects, it may happen that the result is of clas numeric. For example:

> ifelse(TRUE, Sys.Date(), Sys.Date() + 1)
[1] 19298

So, in order to transform the result back to class "Date" using as.Date(), I always need to remember the universal default origin 1970-01-01 and I need to write it out explicitly.

I find that rather inconvenient, and so having the default origin as a default would make very much sense to me here.

Of course, for that particular example, it would also help me if ifelse() would properly handle Date vectors.

Hello,

ifelse does properly handle Date objects. From its documentation:


Usage
ifelse(test, yes, no)
[...]
Value
A vector of the same length and attributes (including dimensions and 
"class") as test and data values from the values of yes or no.


In your example test = TRUE and yes = Sys.Date() so the return value is


class(ifelse(TRUE, Sys.Date(), Sys.Date() + 1))
# [1] "numeric"

class(ifelse(TRUE, Sys.Date(), Sys.Date() + 1L))
# [1] "numeric"


This is expected behavior.
I was expecting class "integer", not "numeric" but this too is 
documented in ?Dates section Details 2nd paragraph.


It is intended that the date should be an integer, but this is not 
enforced in the internal representation. Fractional days will be ignored 
when printing. It is possible to produce fractional days via the mean 
method or by adding or subtracting (see Ops.Date).


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

I routinely use fractional days with class "Date".  I hope I can 
continue to do so.  Thanks, Spencer Graves

Dan,

as.Date() and as.POSIXct() have been updated to allow replacement of the hidden functions .POSIXct() and .Date() which were the only way to correctly convert the numeric representation of the objects as Johannes explained. Given that this is a very common operation (especially with POSIXct) it makes sense to not rely on hidden functions and will allow us to possibly deprecate them. And as Peter pointed out, this is R-devel so manuals won't be necessarily updated until the full functionality is implemented and this is part of a larger overhaul of the date/time functions which has not been finished yet.

Cheers,
Simon

Add my name to those who think this is a good change.

As someone who works daily with medical research data, the number of times I have been 
caugth by failure of statements like
 ?? as.Date(ifelse( is.na(prog.dt), lastfu.dt, prog.dt)
is a large annoyance.??? Replace ifelse by any number of selection processes for choosing 
among ending dates.

Hello.

Building 83314 on R using R-tools I get the following failure which
relates to lines 463--470 in the datetime3.R test:

```

Thank you, Tim.

You were right and the change has happened now.

Subject: [Rd] det(diag(c(NaN, 1))) should be NaN, not 0
Message-ID: <4d6116fe-ecf0-19c8-d572-4eb1a3631d4c@gmail.com>

Hello,

Currently, determinant(A) calculates the determinant of 'A' by factorizing
A=LU and computing prod(diag(U)) [or the logarithm of the absolute value].
The factorization is done by LAPACK routine DGETRF, which gives a status
code INFO, documented [1] as follows:

*>          INFO is INTEGER
*>          = 0:  successful exit
*>          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*>          > 0:  if INFO = i, U(i,i) is exactly zero. The factorization
*>                has been completed, but the factor U is exactly
*>                singular, and division by zero will occur if it is used
*>                to solve a system of equations.

Accordingly, when INF0>0, determinant(A) behaves as det(A)=0, _not_ computing
prod(diag(U)).  The problem here is that DGETRF can _also_ give positive
INFO for matrices containing NaN, which may very well not be singular for some
finite value of NaN.

I claim that, when INFO>0, determinant(A) should _not_ behave as det(A)=0
unconditionally, but rather sometimes (depending on some test) give NaN.
Here is one case where 0 is really "wrong":

 > (A <- diag(c(NaN, 1)))
      [,1] [,2]
[1,]  NaN    0
[2,]    0    1
 > det(A)
[1] 0

R isn't consistent, either:

 > (B <- diag(c(1, NaN)))
      [,1] [,2]
[1,]    1    0
[2,]    0  NaN
 > det(B)
[1] NaN

Here, DGETRF _does_ succeed, because it does not "see" the trailing NaN in 'B'.

So: Should R change to better handle the INFO>0 case?  If so, how?

Ideally (I think), the proposed change would give NaN for 'A' and 'B'
above and 0 for 'C' and 'D' below (both of which really _are_ singular):

 > (C <- matrix(c(NaN, NaN, 0, 0), 2L, 2L))
      [,1] [,2]
[1,]  NaN    0
[2,]  NaN    0
 > det(C)
[1] NaN
 > (D <- t(C))
      [,1] [,2]
[1,]  NaN  NaN
[2,]    0    0
 > det(D)
[1] 0

Furthermore, the proposed change should _not_ decrease the performance
of determinant(A) for nonsingular 'A' ...

For those looking, the relevant C-level function is det_ge_real(),
defined in R-devel/src/modules/lapack/Lapack.c (at line 1260 in r83320).
