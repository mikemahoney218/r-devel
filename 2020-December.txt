Thank you, Duncan and Bill (and Kevin for bringing up the
topic).

I agree  all.equal() should work better with functions,

and I think probably it would make sense to define  all.equal.function()
rather than put this into all.equal.default()

However, it's not quite clear if it is always desirable to check the
environments as well notably as that *is* done recursively.

Bill, I'm sure you've noticed that we did write  all.equal.environment()
to work recursively... Actually, I had worked quite a bit at
that, too long ago to remember details, but the relevant svn log
entry is

more sophisticated all.equal.environment(): no longer "simple" infinite recursions
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Are you sure that code with the internal recursive do1()
function should/could not be amended where needed?

Probably all.equal.environment's do1() could be enhanced to do the
recursion (and look at the environments' attributes).  I wrote a separate
function because it was easier to experiment that way (e.g., when to stop
recursing - it stops when one environment is a top-level environment or the
empty environment).  I've been thinking about similar recursion options for
ls.str() - it would make it easier to debug refClass and R6 code where the
data is somewhere in a stack of environments.

> E1 <- list2env(list(X=1.1, Y=1.2), parent=list2env(list(p=1.3),
parent=baseenv()))
> E2 <- list2env(list(X=1.1, Y=1.2), parent=list2env(list(p=1.4),
parent=baseenv()))
> base::all.equal.environment(E1,E2)

[2] "<parent.env> <parent.env> target is <environment: base> and current is

One more comment:  it might be worthwhile reporting on a case where 
identical(e1, e2) fails when those are the environments associated with 
two functions (though I think not by default in all.equal.environment).

Functions can modify variables in their environment, so examples like 
the open.account example in the R-intro manual would distinguish between 
ross and robert even if the balances matched.

Thank you Luke,

I tried your suggestion about R_MAX_VSIZE but I am not able to get the
error you are getting.
I tried recent R devel as I have seen you made a change to GC there.
My machine is 128GB, free -h reports 125GB available. I tried to set
128, 125 and 100. In all cases the result is "Command terminated by
signal 9". Each took around 6-6.5h.
Details below, if it tells you anything how could I optimize it (or
raise an exception early) please do let me know.

This sort of failure means that a potentially large amount of disk space is not being recovered when R is done.  Perhaps R_CleanTempDir() could call R_unlink() instead of having a subprocess call 'rm -rf ...'.  Then it could also issue a specific warning if it was impossible to delete all of tempdir().  (That should be very rare.)

The fact that your max resident size isn't affected looks odd.  Are
you setting the environment variable outside R? When I run

     env R_MAX_VSIZE=16Gb /usr/bin/time bin/Rscript jg.R 1e9 2e0 0 0

(your code in jg.R). I get a quick failure with 11785524maxresident)k

Best,

luke

This sort of failure means that a potentially large amount of disk space is not being recovered when R is done.  Perhaps R_CleanTempDir() could call R_unlink() instead of having a subprocess call 'rm -rf ...'.  Then it could also issue a specific warning if it was impossible to delete all of tempdir().  (That should be very rare.)

Yes, I do set outside of R, in shell:
R_MAX_VSIZE=100Gb SRC_DATANAME=G1_1e9_2e0_0_0 /usr/bin/time -v Rscript
datatable/groupby-datatable.R

I think it might be related to allocations made with malloc rather than R_alloc.
Probably malloc allocation is not capped by setting this env var.
If so, then I have to limit memory on OS/shell level. As you mentioned before.

This sort of failure means that a potentially large amount of disk space is not being recovered when R is done.  Perhaps R_CleanTempDir() could call R_unlink() instead of having a subprocess call 'rm -rf ...'.  Then it could also issue a specific warning if it was impossible to delete all of tempdir().

Message-ID: <036bf6f5-477c-84e2-db0e-9e3349255229@iqb.hu-berlin.de>

Hi,

not sure whether this belongs here or has been reported/asked before.

In the current R devel the behavior of order() and sort() on data.frames 
with a single row has changed.

Before (release):

 > sort(data.frame("b", "a"))
 ? X.a. X.b.
1??? a??? b

Now (devel):

 > sort(data.frame("b", "a"))
 ? X.b.
1??? b

I did not find any specific documentation in the daily news log on this.

Thanks,
Benjamin

Work in progress.  Likely this will become an error: ? sort clearly says
it does not work on data frames.

Subject: [Rd] translation domain is wrong in stopifnot()?
Message-ID: <CABtg=KmgYOiapjccOVrF-qHSsUYzOtu5RAfiaMrbBidmMmhbwg@mail.gmail.com>

I don't know if this would be considered a bug in either stopifnot()
or (n)gettext(), or not a bug at all, but sometimes the translation
domain is not set properly for stopifnot() messages, so they won't be
translated. E.g.

Sys.setenv(LANGUAGE = "de")

# This is good
stopifnot(FALSE)
#> Fehler: FALSE ist nicht TRUE

f <- function() stopifnot(FALSE)
# This is not
f()
#> Fehler in f() : FALSE is not TRUE

I haven't checked the above reference.
But I would like to note the following behaviour:

    #e group
    e = new.env ()
    e1 = new.env ()
    e$e = e1
    e1$e = e

    #f group
    f = new.env ()
    f1 = new.env ()
    f2 = new.env ()
    f$e = f1
    f1$e = f2
    f2$e = f

    all.equal (e, f)

I tried a number of examples with circular references.
All worked correctly, except for "identical" environments nested an
unequal number of times.

I suspect there may be other special cases.

Thank you, Ben.   I'm using adjustcolor() very often, and I had
also wondered about the documentation "FIXME" there.

As I've not been a real expert in color space transformations, I
hadn't dared to describe it myself,  but your description above
is clearly better than the emptyness ...

Maybe someone can add something, or contribute some example(s)
on how using offset != 0  makes sense ?

One might say that adjustcolor() performs affine color transformation. Argument 'offset' defines the shift in color space after the linear transformation defined by argument 'transform'. In other words, 'offset' represents additive color mixing (in the sense of adding lights, not paints) after linear transformation.

> red <- rgb(1, 0, 0)
> green <- c(0, 0.9, 0, 1)
> adjustcolor(red, 1, 0.9, 0.9, 0.9, offset=green)
[1] "#E6E600FF"

("red + green = yellow")

However, the implementation of adjustcolor() is a bit inconsistent with this description as it does not force 'offset' to be a color by using col2rgb(offset, alpha=TRUE)/255. The help page already gives an example for using 'offset' for the purpose of adding white light.

I agree there is a bug.

The problem is that the default for the optional 'domain'
argument does not "work" correctly in the 2nd case.

I've checked that this can be worked around if I explicitly add

  , domain = "R-base"

to the ngettext() call   [ and also the gettext() call above ] .
Then I do get

  > (function() stopifnot(1))()
  Fehler in (function() stopifnot(1))() : 1 ist nicht TRUE

For now I'd claim the bug is in the underlying C code of
gettext() , ngettext() ...

It would we good to report this in R's bugzilla, please,

A small  "work in progress" update (because I've been advancing slowly only):

I'm currently testing 'make check-all' after

1) adding all.equal.function() method,
2) not changing  all.equal.environment() yet
3) but adapting all.equal.default() to give a deprecating warning
   when called with a function

all.equal.function <- function(target, current, check.environments = TRUE, ...)
{
    msg <- all.equal.language(target, current, ...)
    if(check.environments) {
        ## pre-check identical(), for speed *and* against infinite recursion:
        ee <- identical(environment(target), environment(current), ignore.environment=FALSE)
        if(!ee)
            ee <- all.equal.environment(environment(target), environment(current), ...)
        if(isTRUE(msg))
            ee
        else
            c(msg, if(!isTRUE(ee)) ee)
    } else
        msg
}

It's amazing that this breaks our own checks in several places,
which I'm chasing slowly (being busy with teaching related
duties, etc).
I did have the correct gut feeling to have 'check.environments'
being an optional argument, because indeed there are cases (in
our own regression tests) where we now needed to change the
checks to use   check.environments=FALSE .

My plan is to finish the   all.equal.function()  functionality /
modify "base R" coded (or, for now, rather the testing code)
where needed, and then *commit* that to R-devel.

After that we should come back to improve or even re-write
all.equal.environment()  when needed.

', check.environments = FALSE' to an existing  stopifnot(all.equal(..))
check.

Consequently, I expect some  "carnage" in checks of existing  CRAN / BioC 
(and github, etc but that does not count) packages.

The NEWS entry (in 'NEW FEATURES') mentions an important case :

    ? all.equal(f, g) for functions now by default also compares their
      environment(.)s, notably via new all.equal method for class
      function.  Comparison of nls() fits, e.g., may now need
      all.equal(m1, m2, check.environments=FALSE).

So if you are a package maintainer observing that all.equal() --
or its corresponding 'testthat' obfuscation -- signals errors
"suddenly" (and only in R-devel), it's that you need to add
'check.environments=FALSE' there.

The good news is that this works also in existing (and previous)
versions of R :

  > all.equal(lm,lm, check.environments=FALSE)
  [1] TRUE
  > 

thanks to the "..."  _feature_ of typically just silently swallowing
everything that's not understood.  (yes: _feature_ is tongue in cheek).

Subject: [Rd] New pipe operator
Message-ID: <e55c2093-0bb5-5f9b-5521-0ca8bdf35953@gmail.com>

Just saw this on the R-devel news:


R now provides a simple native pipe syntax ?|>? as well as a shorthand 
notation for creating functions, e.g. ?\(x) x + 1? is parsed as 
?function(x) x + 1?. The pipe implementation as a syntax transformation 
was motivated by suggestions from Jim Hester and Lionel Henry. These 
features are experimental and may change prior to release.


This is a good addition; by using "|>" instead of "%>%" there should be 
a chance to get operator precedence right.  That said, the ?Syntax help 
topic hasn't been updated, so I'm not sure where it fits in.

There are some choices that take a little getting used to:

 > mtcars |> head
Error: The pipe operator requires a function call or an anonymous 
function expression as RHS

(I need to say mtcars |> head() instead.)  This sometimes leads to error 
messages that are somewhat confusing:

 > mtcars |> magrittr::debug_pipe |> head
Error: function '::' not supported in RHS call of a pipe

but

mtcars |> magrittr::debug_pipe() |> head()

works.

Overall, I think this is a great addition, though it's going to be 
disruptive for a while.

To me, this error looks much more friendly than magrittr's error.
Some of them got too used to specify functions without (). This
is OK until they use `::`, but when they need to use it, it takes
hours to figure out why

mtcars %>% base::head
#> Error in .::base : unused argument (head)

won't work but

mtcars %>% head

works. I think this is a too harsh lesson for ordinary R users to
learn `::` is a function. I've been wanting for magrittr to drop the
support for a function name without () to avoid this confusion,
so I would very much welcome the new pipe operator's behavior.
Thank you all the developers who implemented this!

Best,
Hiroaki Yutani

I agree, it's an improvement on the corresponding magrittr error.

I think the semantics of not evaluating the RHS, but treating the pipe 
as purely syntactical is a good decision.

I'm not sure I like the recommended way to pipe into a particular argument:

   mtcars |> subset(cyl == 4) |> \(d) lm(mpg ~ disp, data = d)

or

   mtcars |> subset(cyl == 4) |> function(d) lm(mpg ~ disp, data = d)

both of which are equivalent to

   mtcars |> subset(cyl == 4) |> (function(d) lm(mpg ~ disp, data = d))()

It's tempting to suggest it should allow something like

   mtcars |> subset(cyl == 4) |> lm(mpg ~ disp, data = .)

which would be expanded to something equivalent to the other versions: 
but that makes it quite a bit more complicated.  (Maybe _ or \. should 
be used instead of ., since those are not legal variable names.)

I don't think there should be an attempt to copy magrittr's special 
casing of how . is used in determining whether to also include the 
previous value as first argument.

I support the idea of using an underscore (_) as the placeholder symbol. 
  Syntactic sugars work the the best if 1) they require less keystrokes 
and/or 2) are easier to read compared to the "normal" syntax, and 3) can 
not lead to unexpected bugs (which is a major problem with the magrittr 
pipe). Using '_' fulfills all of these criteria since '_' can not clash 
with any variable in the environment.

Thank you for this example. I agree but think that the new base R pipe
might trigger some initial confusion as well:

    mtcars |> function(x) dim(x)[1L]
    #> [1] 32

    mtcars |> nrow
    #> Error: The pipe operator requires a function call or an anonymous
function expression as RHS

The RHS evaluates to the same thing in both cases (bar attributes and
environments), but only the anonymous variant is supported. I admit that
I haven't used %>% before; maybe the above discrepancy is less
irritating for those who have. The error message is clear though!

That said, I think the code is very readable when piping explicitly into
an anonymous function and I also prefer

    mtcars |> nrow()

over mtcars |> nrow, because we are visibly calling something.

IMO, readability is lost when using the cryptic short-hand notation

    mtcars |> \(x) dim(x)[1L]

which really only saves 7 letters.

I guess "_" as a placeholder would be difficult to implement precisely
because it currently is a syntax error.

Which is really not that far off from

mtcars |> subset(cyl == 4) |> \(.) lm(mpg ~ disp, data = .)

once you get used to it.

One consequence of the implementation is that it's not clear how
multiple occurrences of the placeholder would be interpreted. With
magrittr,

sort(runif(10)) %>% ecdf(.)(.)
## [1] 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0

This is probably what you would expect, if you expect it to work at all, and not

ecdf(sort(runif(10)))(sort(runif(10)))

There would be no such ambiguity with anonymous functions

sort(runif(10)) |> \(.) ecdf(.)(.)

I strongly oppose adding a placeholder. Allowing for an optional
placeholder significantly complicates both implementing and explaining
the semantics. For a simple syntax transformation to be viable it
would also require some restrictions, such as only allowing a
placeholder as a top level argument and only once. Checking that these
restrictions are met, and accurately signaling when they are not with
reasonable error messages, is essentially an unsolvable problem given
R's semantics.

The case where the LHS is to be passed as something other than the
first argument is unusual. For me, having that case stand out by using
a function expression makes it much easier to see and so makes the
code easier to understand. As a wearer of progressive bifocals
and someone whose screen is not always free of small dust particles,
having to spot the non-standard pipe stages by seeing a placeholder,
especially a . placeholder, is be a bug, not a feature.

I didn't suggest that.  That would be a bad.  All I suggested was 
different sugar to write (function(d) ecdf(d)(d))().

I thought I did but maybe I missed something. You are right that
supporting a placeholder makes things a lot more complicated. For
being able to easily recognize the non-standard cases _ is better than
. but for me at least not by much.

We did try a number of variations; the code is in the R-syntax branch.
At the root of that branch are two .md files with some notes as of
around useR20. Once things settle down I may update those and look
into turning them into a blog post.

Best,

luke

Thanks for the information!

Can I make a suggestion? If the variation of the pipe that allows
a symbol on the RHS to be interpreted as the name of a function to call
does get chosen, may it also allow fully-qualified symbols?

It just tested it to be sure, but it works fine for me. Are you using
the official installer from
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rdevel.html ?

The default install path is not R-test C:\Program Files\R\R-devel.
Perhaps you have old files lingering from previous installations that
cause permission problems during the installation process?

I clicked on the download link at
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rdevel.html
and then opened the downloaded file which starts the installation process.
I specified a new directory that does not exist, R-test, to be sure that
it would not get confused with an old directory.

I repeated this using different directories and on different days.

I tried it from a user and an Admin account.

If I use the exact same procedure to install R-4.0.3patched it works.

I have successfully downloaded and installed R maybe hundreds
of times over the last 10 to 20 years and have never before
encountered this.

Luke and others,

Can anyone comment on how this new pipe operator will interoperate with existing pipe methods or packages like the tidyverse that currently do things using them?

What differences might it make for efficiency? For example, making an anonymous function just so you can call another function and pass along the results to somewhere other than the first argument sounds like extra overhead. But the anonymous function does provide some interesting scenarios that allow things like a sort of tee functionality that may print/graph  a mid-stream result as well as pass it along the pipeline or do amusing things like apply multiple steps to the data and perhaps concatenate some of the results in the output. Of course, that can be done now with a non-anonymous function.

Perhaps we should name one version (or the other) a pipette or a pipe dream ?

The name "pipe" feels better in the new version as "|>" has the UNIX pipe symbol "|" in it.

I'm surprised by the aversion to

mtcars |> nrow

over

mtcars |> nrow()

and I think the decision to disallow the former should be
reconsidered.  The pipe operator is only going to be used when the rhs
is a function, so there is no ambiguity with omitting the parentheses.
If it's disallowed, it becomes inconsistent with other treatments like
sapply(mtcars, typeof) where sapply(mtcars, typeof()) would just be
noise.  I'm not sure why this decision was taken

If the only issue is with the double (and triple) colon operator, then
ideally `mtcars |> base::head` should resolve to `base::head(mtcars)`
-- in other words, demote the precedence of |>

Obviously (looking at the R-Syntax branch) this decision was
considered, put into place, then dropped, but I can't see why
precisely.

Best,


Hugh.

The construct utils::head  is not that common but bare functions are
very common and to make it harder to use the common case so that
the uncommon case is slightly easier is not desirable.

Also it is trivial to write this which does work:

mtcars %>% (utils::head)

We went back and forth on this several times. The key advantage of
requiring parentheses is to keep things simple and consistent.  Let's
get some experience with that. If experience shows requiring
parentheses creates too many issues then we can add the option of
dropping them later (with special handling of :: and :::). It's easier
to add flexibility and complexity than to restrict it after the fact.

Best,

luke

The :: is a case that we worked to get right with wrapr dot-pipe. I shared notes on this S3/S4 pipe in the R journal https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2018/RJ-2018-042/index.html

library(magrittr)
packageVersion("magrittr")
# [1] ?2.0.1?
5 %>% base::sin
# Error in .::base : unused argument (sin)

library(wrapr)
5 %.>% base::sin

 Error: function '::' not supported in RHS call of a pipe

To me, this error looks much more friendly than magrittr's error.
Some of them got too used to specify functions without (). This
is OK until they use `::`, but when they need to use it, it takes
hours to figure out why

mtcars %>% base::head
#> Error in .::base : unused argument (head)

won't work but

mtcars %>% head

works. I think this is a too harsh lesson for ordinary R users to
learn `::` is a function. I've been wanting for magrittr to drop the
support for a function name without () to avoid this confusion,
so I would very much welcome the new pipe operator's behavior.
Thank you all the developers who implemented this!

I agree, it's an improvement on the corresponding magrittr error.

I think the semantics of not evaluating the RHS, but treating the pipe
as purely syntactical is a good decision.

I'm not sure I like the recommended way to pipe into a particular argument:

  mtcars |> subset(cyl == 4) |> \(d) lm(mpg ~ disp, data = d)

or

  mtcars |> subset(cyl == 4) |> function(d) lm(mpg ~ disp, data = d)

both of which are equivalent to

  mtcars |> subset(cyl == 4) |> (function(d) lm(mpg ~ disp, data = d))()

It's tempting to suggest it should allow something like

  mtcars |> subset(cyl == 4) |> lm(mpg ~ disp, data = .)

Which is really not that far off from

mtcars |> subset(cyl == 4) |> \(.) lm(mpg ~ disp, data = .)

once you get used to it.

One consequence of the implementation is that it's not clear how
multiple occurrences of the placeholder would be interpreted. With
magrittr,

sort(runif(10)) %>% ecdf(.)(.)
## [1] 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0

This is probably what you would expect, if you expect it to work at all, and not

ecdf(sort(runif(10)))(sort(runif(10)))

There would be no such ambiguity with anonymous functions

sort(runif(10)) |> \(.) ecdf(.)(.)

-Deepayan

which would be expanded to something equivalent to the other versions:
but that makes it quite a bit more complicated.  (Maybe _ or \. should
be used instead of ., since those are not legal variable names.)

I don't think there should be an attempt to copy magrittr's special
casing of how . is used in determining whether to also include the
previous value as first argument.

2020?12?4?(?) 20:51 Duncan Murdoch <murdoch.duncan at gmail.com<mailto:murdoch.duncan at gmail.com>>:

Just saw this on the R-devel news:


R now provides a simple native pipe syntax ?|>? as well as a shorthand
notation for creating functions, e.g. ?\(x) x + 1? is parsed as
?function(x) x + 1?. The pipe implementation as a syntax transformation
was motivated by suggestions from Jim Hester and Lionel Henry. These
features are experimental and may change prior to release.


This is a good addition; by using "|>" instead of "%>%" there should be
a chance to get operator precedence right.  That said, the ?Syntax help
topic hasn't been updated, so I'm not sure where it fits in.

There are some choices that take a little getting used to:

mtcars |> head
Error: The pipe operator requires a function call or an anonymous
function expression as RHS

(I need to say mtcars |> head() instead.)  This sometimes leads to error
messages that are somewhat confusing:

mtcars |> magrittr::debug_pipe |> head
Error: function '::' not supported in RHS call of a pipe

but

mtcars |> magrittr::debug_pipe() |> head()

works.

Overall, I think this is a great addition, though it's going to be
disruptive for a while.

I can't understand why so many people are calling this a "pipe".
Pipes connect processes, via their I/O streams.
Arguably, a more general interpretation would include sockets and files.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_pipe
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_pipe

As far as I can tell, the magrittr-like operators are functions (not
pipes), with nonstandard syntax.
This is not consistent with R's original design philosophy, building
on C, Lisp and S, along with lots of *important* math and stats.

It's possible that some parties are interested in creating a kind of
"data pipeline".
I'm interested in this myself, and I think we could discuss this more.
But I'm not convinced the magrittr-like operators help to achieve this goal.
Which, in my opinion, would require one to model programs as directed
graphs, along with some degree of asynchronous input.

Presumably, these operators will be added to R anyway, and (almost) no
one will listen to me.

So, I would like to make one suggestion:
Is it possible for these operators to *not* be named:
    The R Pipe
    The S Pipe
    Or anything with a similar meaning.

Maybe tidy pipe, or something else that links it to its proponents?

If we?re being mathematically pedantic, the ?pipe? operator is actually
function composition.

That being said, pipes are a simple and well-known idiom. While being less
than mathematically exact, it seems a reasonable   label for the (very
useful) behavior.

It is common practice to call |> as pipe (or pipeline operator) among

Pipeline is a
common feature for functional programming, not just for "data pipeline."

    F#: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/symbol-and-operator-reference/
    Elixir: https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/operators.html#general-operators
    Typescript:

(This blog post about the history of pipe operator might be
interesting: https://mamememo.blogspot.com/2019/06/a-brief-history-of-pipeline-operator.html
)

I agree this is a bit confusing for those who are familiar with other
"pipe" concepts,
but there's no other appropriate term to call |>.

Hello,

If Hilbert liked beer, I like "pipe".

More seriously, a new addition like this one is going to cause problems 
yet unknown. But it's a good idea to have a pipe operator available. As 
someone used to magrittr's data pipelines, I will play with this base 
one before making up my mind. I don't expect its behavior to be exactly 
like magrittr "%>%" (and it's not). For the moment all I can say is that 
it is something R users are used to and that it now avoids loading a 
package.
As for the new way to define anonymous functions, I am less sure. Too 
much syntatic sugar? Or am I finding the syntax ugly?

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Luke,
When writing a blog post on that, could you please describe
performance implications that this new feature will carry?
AFAIU, compared to a standard way of using temporary variables, pipes
will allow to not increment REFCNT of objects being piped into.
Therefore peak memory usage could be lower in some cases.

As for brackets required on RHS, I think it makes sense to be
consistent and either require brackets for anonymous functions the
same way we require for function name, or not require brackets for
both of them.

Best,
Jan

Subject: [Rd] as.POSIXct.numeric change default of origin argument
Message-ID: <CAOO9MKUcye7E00SBEGWMQpCR-Z9q6yAdM0nM=QqRqb8T8jfRbA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I would like to propose to change the default value for "origin"
argument in as.POSIXct.numeric method, from current missing to new
"1970-01-01".
My proposal is motivated by the fact that this is the most commonly
needed value for "origin" argument and having that as a default seems
reasonable.
Proposed change seems to be pretty safe because it is now an error.

Best Regards,
Jan Gorecki

	  The fda package already includes as.POSIXct1970, which also sets 
tz="GMT" by default.


	  I made the equivalent thing for as.Date available as 
"Ecfun::as.Date1970".


	  If the Core R team doesn't want to make the change for the existing 
functions, they might consider adding alternatives like this.  And, of 
course, Jan Gorecki and others can use these (if they aren't already 
using them or something equivalent).

I would also be in favor of this (and have been for years), mostly to make 
it consistent with the as.numeric() method. Same for "Date".

To support the latter, the "zoo" package provides a separate as.Date() 
generic that enables the as.Date.numeric() with different default.

The main argument of R Core against it is that it is too uncertain whether 
the origin is really 1970-01-01, e.g., when importing from Excel or SAS.

Best wishes,
Z

Dear Luke,

In the meantime I checked the R-syntax branch and the docs; they are 
very helpful. I would also like to thank you for putting effort into 
this feature. Keeping it at the syntax level is also a very smart 
decision. However, the current API might not exploit the full power of 
the basic idea.

1) Requiring either an anonymous function or a function call, but not 
allowing for symbols which point to functions is inconsistent and will 
be misleading for non-experts.

foo <- function(x) x
identical(foo, function(x) x)

mtcars |> foo               #bang!
mtcars |> function(x) x     #fine?

You stated in :
"
Another variation supported by the implementation is that a symbol on
the RHS is interpreted as the name of a function to call with the LHS
as argument:

```r
 > quote(x |> f)
f(x)
```
"

So clearly this is not an implementation issue but a design decision.

As a remedy, two different pipe operators could be introduced:

LHS |> RHS    -> RHS is treated as a function call
LHS |>> RHS   -> RHS is treated as a function

If |>> is used, it would not matter which notation is used for the RHS 
expression; the parser would assume it evaluates to a function.

2) Simplified lambda expression:
IMHO in the vast majority of use cases, this is used for single-argument 
functions, so parenthesis would not be required. Hence, both forms would 
be valid and equivalent:

\x x + 1
\(x) x + 1


3) Function composition:
Allowing for concise composition of functions would be a great feature. 
E.g., instead of

foo <- function(x) print(mean(sqrt(x), na.rm = TRUE), digits = 2)

or

foo <- \x {x |> sqrt() |> mean(na.rm = TRUE) |> print(digits = 2)}

one could write

foo <- \x |> sqrt() |> mean(na.rm = TRUE) |> print(digits = 2)

So basically if the lambda argument is followed by a pipe operator, the 
pipe chain is transformed to a function body where the first lambda 
argument is inserted into the first position of the pipeline.


Best,
Denes

I tried it from another computer and it did work.  Is there some way
of installing R devel using the analog of the R --vanilla flag so that I can
do it in a reproducible manner. It seems to remember prior settings
and maybe that is a problem although one would not expect a setting
that could lead to what occurs.  I don't see anything documenting flags
on the Rtools40 page.

I meant on the R devel download page. (I was just installing Rtools40
on another computer.)

Naming is another whole topic.

I have seen suggestions that the current pipeline symbol used be phrased as THEN so

data %>% f1 %>% f2()

would be said as something like:
take data then apply f1 then f2

or some variants.

There are words other than pipe or pipeline that might also work such as "assembly line" or "conveyor belt" that might fit some kinds of pipelining better than others. My original exposure to UNIX in the early 80's used a pipeline of multiple processes whose standard input and/or standard output (and sometimes also standard error) were redirected to an anonymous "pipe" device that buffered whatever (usually) text that was thrown at it and the processes reading and writing from it were paused and restarted as needed when data was ready. Problems often could be decomposed into multiple parts that had a solution using some program and it was not unusual to do something like:

	cat *.c | grep -v ... | grep ... | sed ... | cut ... >output

Of course something like the above was often rewritten to be done within a single awk script or perl or whatever. You could view the above though from the perspective of "data" in some form, often text, being passed from one function(ality) to another and changing a bit each step of the way. A very common use of this form of pipeline was used to deal with embedded text in a different language in typsetting:

	tbl filename | eqn | pic | troff | ...

The above would open a file, pass through all lines except those between markers that specified a table starting and ending. Those lines would be processed and transformed into the troff language equivalent. The old plus new lines now went to eqn which found and transformed equations similarly then to pic which transformed instructions it knew to image descriptions in troff and finally troff processed the whole mess and then off to the printer.

Clearly the above can be seen as a data pipeline using full processes as nodes.

The way R is using the pipeline may just use functions but you can imagine it as having similarities and differences. Current implementations may be linear with lazy evaluation and with every part running to completion before the next part starts. Every "object" is fully made, then used, then often removed as a temporary object. There is no buffering. But in principle, you can make UNIX-like pipelines using parallelism within a process too. 

Would there be scenarios where phrases like "assembly line" or "conveyor belt" make sense to describe the method properly? The word pipe suggests a linearity to some whereas conveyor belts these days also can be used to selectively shunt things one way or another as in assembling all parts of your order from different parts of a warehouse and arranging they all end up in the same delivery area. Making applications do that dynamically may have other names. Think flowchart!

Time to go do something useful.

Pipeline is a
common feature for functional programming, not just for "data pipeline."

(This blog post about the history of pipe operator might be
interesting: https://mamememo.blogspot.com/2019/06/a-brief-history-of-pipeline-operator.html
)

I agree this is a bit confusing for those who are familiar with other "pipe" concepts, but there's no other appropriate term to call |>.

You are missing the point.  The value of the RHS is irrelevant to the 
transformation.  All that matters is its form.  So "foo" and 
"function(x) x" are completely different things, even if identical() 
thinks their value is the same.

It's also true that "foo()" and "function(x) x" are completely 
different, but they are well-defined forms:  one is a call, the other is 
an anonymous function definition.

Accepting a plain "foo" would add a third form (a name), which might 
make sense, but hardly gains anything: whereas dropping the anonymous 
function definition costs quite a bit.  Without special-casing anonymous 
function definitions you'd need to enter

mtcars |> (function(x) x)()

or

mtcars |> (\(x) x)()

which are both quite difficult to read.

We are at the syntax level, so of course we do not know the value of the 
RHS when the parsing occurs. I *do* understand that the *form* is 
important here, but how do you explain this to a rookie R user? He will 
see that he entered two expressions which he thinks are identical, even 
though they are not identical at the level when the parsing occurs.

Also think of the potential users of this syntax. There are at least two 
groups:
1) ~95% of the users: active users of `%>%`. My experience is that the 
vast majority of them do not use the "advanced" features of magrittr; 
however, they are got used to things like mtcars |> print. Provide them 
with the RHS-as-symbol syntax and they will be happy - they have a 
plug-and-forget replacement. Or do enforce a function call - they will 
be unhappy, and will not adopt the new syntax.
2) ~5% of the users (including me): have not used magrittr or any other 
(probably better) implementations (e.g., pipeR, wrapr) of the pipe 
operator because it could lead to nasty performance issues, bugs, and 
debugging problems. However, from the functional-programming-style of 
view, these users might prefer the new syntax and as few typing as 
possible.

I would reverse the argumentation: Luke has a working implementation for 
the case if the RHS is a single symbol. What do we loose if we keep it?

I would explain that you almost always need the parens.  Rookies don't 
need to learn about anonymous functions instantly.  Once they get to the 
point of learning about anonymous functions, I'd say they are the sole 
exception to needing parens.

Allowing a name will confuse people who think stats::sd is a name of a 
function in the stats package.  stats::sd() works with the current 
design, allowing stats::sd will add another special case (and then of 
course you'd need stats:::sd, object$method, etc.)

The following gives an error.

   1 |> `+`(2)
   ## Error: function '+' is not supported in RHS call of a pipe

   1 |> `+`()
   ## Error: function '+' is not supported in RHS call of a pipe

but this does work:

   1 |> (`+`)(2)
   ## [1] 3

   1 |> (`+`)()
   ## [1] 1

The error message suggests that this was intentional.
It isn't mentioned in ?"|>"

?"|>" says:

      To avoid ambiguities, functions in ?rhs? calls may not
      be syntactically special, such as ?+? or ?if?.

(used to say lhs; fixed now).

Why is that ambiguous?  It works in magrittr.

Topic is more about anonymous functions but also pipes.

Rui thought the proposed syntax was a bit ugly. I assume the \(x) ... was what he means, not the function(x)... version.

Many current languages have played games on adding some form of anonymous function that is defined and used in place. Some go to great pains to make various parts optional to the point where there are many valid way to create a function that takes no arguments so you can leave out almost everything else as optional.

I admit having to type "lambda" all the time (in some languages)  is not preferable but in English, something shorter like fun(...) or func(...) instead of function(...) might be more readable than the weird choice of \(. Yes. You can view the combo to bring attention to the fact the "(" is meant not as any old paren for other uses but specifically for function invocation/definition purposes. But overuse of the backslash to mean other things such as in regular expressions and the parentheses for so many things, makes parsing for humans harder. So does "|>" for the new pipe symbol as it can also look like "or greater than" and since some humans do not insert spaces to make code even shorter, it can be a challenge to rapidly see a line of code as tokens.

If programming were being invented today with a larger set of symbols, it might use more of them and perhaps look more like APL. We might have all of the built-in to the language tokens be single symbols including real arrows instead of -> and a not-equals symbol like  ? instead of != or ~= s some languages use. In that system, what might the pipe symbol look like?

?

But although making things concise is nice, sometimes there is clarity in using enough room, to make things clear or we might as well code in binary.

Subject: Re: [Rd] New pipe operator

Hello,

If Hilbert liked beer, I like "pipe".

More seriously, a new addition like this one is going to cause problems yet unknown. But it's a good idea to have a pipe operator available. As someone used to magrittr's data pipelines, I will play with this base one before making up my mind. I don't expect its behavior to be exactly like magrittr "%>%" (and it's not). For the moment all I can say is that it is something R users are used to and that it now avoids loading a package.
As for the new way to define anonymous functions, I am less sure. Too much syntatic sugar? Or am I finding the syntax ugly?

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

For now, all functions marked internally as syntactically special are
disallowed. Not all of these lead to ambiguities.

I think multiplying the operators would not be a net positive. You'd then
have to remember and mix them when you mix anonymous functions and
non-anonymous functions.  It would result in

LHS |> RHS1() |>> \(x,y) blablabla |> RHS3()

I think thats too much intricacy. Better to be a little more restrictive
in way that (honestly doesnt' really hurt anything afaics, and) guarantees
consistency.

Why special case something here when soemtimes you'll want more than one
argument. The parentheses seem really not a big deal. So I don't understand
the motivation here, if I'm being honest.

This one I disagree with very strongly. Reading pipelines would suddenly
require a *much* higher cognitive load than before because you have to
model that complexity just to read it and know what it says. The brackets
there seem like an extremely low price to pay to avoid that. Operator
precedence should be extremely and easily predictable.

As someone who switches back and forth between using standard R methods and those of the tidyverse, depending on the problem, my mood and whether Jupiter aligns with Saturn in the new age of Aquarius, I have a question about the forthcoming built-in pipe. Will it motivate anyone to eventually change or enhance the ggplot functionality to have a version that gets rid of the odd use of the addition symbol?

I mean I now sometimes have a pipeline that looks like:

Data %>%
	Do_this %>%
	Do_that(whatever) %>%
	ggplot(...) +
		geom_whatever(...) +
		...

My understanding is this is a bit of a historical anomaly that might someday be modified back.

As I understand it, the call to ggplot() creates a partially filled-in object that holds all kinds of useful info. The additional calls to geom_point() and so on will add/change that hidden object. Nothing much happens till the object is implicitly or explicitly given to print() which switches to the print function for objects of that type and creates a graph based on the contents of the object at that time. So, in theory, you could have a pipelined version of ggplot where the first function accepts something like a  data.frame or tibble as the default first argument and at the end returns the object we have been describing. All additional functions would then accept such an object as the (hidden?) first argument and return the modified object. The final function in the pipe would either have the value captured in a variable for later use or print implicitly generating a graph.

So the above silly example might become:

Data %>%
	Do_this %>%
	Do_that(whatever) %>%
	ggplot(...) %>%
	geom_whatever(...) %>%
	...

Or, am I missing something here? 

The language and extensions such as are now in the tidyverse might be more streamlined and easier to read when using consistent notation. If we now build a reasonable version of the pipeline in, might we encourage other uses to gradually migrate back closer to the mainstream?

Subject: Re: [Rd] New pipe operator

Hello,

If Hilbert liked beer, I like "pipe".

More seriously, a new addition like this one is going to cause problems yet unknown. But it's a good idea to have a pipe operator available. As someone used to magrittr's data pipelines, I will play with this base one before making up my mind. I don't expect its behavior to be exactly like magrittr "%>%" (and it's not). For the moment all I can say is that it is something R users are used to and that it now avoids loading a package.
As for the new way to define anonymous functions, I am less sure. Too much syntatic sugar? Or am I finding the syntax ugly?

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Hadley's answer (#7 here: 
https://community.rstudio.com/t/why-cant-ggplot2-use/4372) makes it 
pretty clear that he thinks it would have been nice now if he had made 
that choice when ggplot2 came out, but it's not worth the effort now to 
change it.

Nothing much happens till the object is implicitly or explicitly given to print() which switches to the print function for objects of that type and creates a graph based on the contents of the object at that time. So, in theory, you could have a pipelined version of ggplot where the first function accepts something like a  data.frame or tibble as the default first argument and at the end returns the object we have been describing. All additional functions would then accept such an object as the (hidden?) first argument and return the modified object. The final function in the pipe would either have the value captured in a variable for later use or print implicitly generating a graph.

As someone used to magrittr's data pipelines, I will play with this base one before making up my mind. I don't expect its behavior to be exactly like magrittr "%>%" (and it's not). For the moment all I can say is that it is something R users are used to and that it now avoids loading a package.

That was just a secondary option for the case if pure symbols are 
disallowed on the RHS. The point is that one can not avoid inconsistency 
here because of practical considerations; let us admit, R has tons of 
inconsistencies which are usually motivated by making interactive data 
analysis more convenient. To me it seems more inconsistent to allow for 
function calls and functions but not symbols - either allow all of them 
or be strict and enforce function calls.

Just as I told before: because of practical considerations. In a 
Hungarian keyboard layout, this is how one types the backslash 
character: RightAlt+Q. Parenthesis: Shift+8 (left), Shift+9 (Right). 
This is how you type 'function' in the R terminal: fu+TAB. I do not 
really see the point of the new notation as it is now.

Unfortunately I could not come up with a better solution to approximate 
a function composition operator (supporting tacit/pointfree-style 
programming) which avoids the introduction of a separate function (like 
e.g. purrr::compose).

In Haskell:
floor . sqrt

In Julia (looks nice but requires \circTAB or custom keybinding):
floor ? sqrt

In R: ?

I think the real issue here is that functions are supposed to be
first class objects in R
or are supposed to be and |> would break that if if is possible
to write function(x) x + 1 on the RHS but not foo (assuming foo
was defined as that function).

I don't think getting experience with using it can change that
inconsistency which seems serious to me and needs to
be addressed even if it complicates the implementation
since it drives to the heart of what R is.

With respect I think this is a misunderstanding of what is happening here.

Functions are first class citizens. |> is, for all intents and purposes, a
*macro. *

LHS |> RHS(arg2=5)

*parses to*

RHS(LHS, arg2 = 5)

There are no functions at the point in time when the pipe transformation
happens, because no code has been evaluated. To know if a symbol is going
to evaluate to a function requires evaluation which is a step entirely
after the one where the |> pipe is implemented.

Another way to think about it is that

LHS |> RHS(arg2 = 5)

is another way of *writing* RHS(LHS, arg2 = 5), NOT R code that is (or even
can be) evaluated.


Now this is a subtle point that only really has implications in as much as
it is not the case for magrittr pipes, but its relevant for discussions
like this, I think.

I understand very well that it is implemented at the syntax level;
however, in any case the implementation is irrelevant to the principles.

Here a similar example to the one I gave before but this time written out:

This works:

  3 |> function(x) x + 1

but this does not:

  foo <- function(x) x + 1
  3 |> foo

so it breaks the principle of functions being first class objects.  foo and its
definition are not interchangeable.  You have
to write 3 |> foo() but don't have to write 3 |> (function(x) x + 1)().

This isn't just a matter of notation, i.e. foo vs foo(), but is a
matter of breaking
the way R works as a functional language with first class functions.

Seems like this *could* be a good thing, and thanks to R core for considering it. But, FWIW:

 - I agree with Gabor G that consistency of "syntax" should be paramount here. Enough problems have been caused by earlier superficially-convenient non-standard features in R.  In particular:

 -- there should not be any discrepancy between an in-place function-definition, and a predefined function attached to a symbol (as per Gabor's point). 
 
 -- Hence, the ability to say x |> foo  ie without parentheses, seems bound to lead to inconsistency, because x |> foo is allowed, x |> base::foo isn't allowed without tricks, but x |> function( y) foo( y) isn't... So, x |> foo is not worth keeping. Parentheses are a price well worth paying.
 
 -- it is still inconsistent and confusing to (apparently) invoke a function in some places--- normally--- via 'foo(x)', yet in others--- pipily--- via 'foo()'. Especially if 'foo' already has a default value for its first argument.

 - I don't see the problem with a placeholder--- doesn't it remove all ambiguity? Sure there needs to be a standard unclashable name and people can argue about what that should be, but the following seems clear and flexible... to me, anyway:
 
 thing |> 
   foo( _PIPE_) |>           # standard
   bah( arg1, _PIPE_) |>   # multi-arg function
   _ANON_({ x <- sum( _PIPE_); _PIPE_/x + x/_PIPE_ })   # anon function
  
where '_PIPE_' is the ordained name of the placeholder, and '_ANON_' constructs-and-calls a function with single argument '_PIPE_'. There is just one rule (I think...): each pipe-stage must be a *call* involving the argument '_PIPE_'.


 - The proposed anonymous-function syntax looks quite ugly to me, diminishing readability and inviting errors. The new pipe symbol |> already looks scarily like quantum mechanics; adding \( just puts fishbones into the symbolic soup.

 - IMO it's not worth going too far to try to lure magritter-etc fans to swap to the new; my experience is that many people keep using older inferior R syntax for years after better replacements become available (even if they are aware of replacements), for various reasons. Just provide a good framework, and let nature take its course.
 
 - Disclaimer: personally I'm not much of a pipehead anyway, so maybe I'm not the audience. But if I was to consider piping, I wouldn't be very tempted by the current proposal. OTOH, I might even be tempted to write--- and use!--- my own version of '%|>%' as above (maybe someone already has). And if R did it for me, that'd be great :)
 
[*] Definition of _ANON_ could be something like this--- almost certainly won't work as-is, this is just to point out that it could be done in standard R.

`_ANON_` <- function( expr) { 
  #1. Construct a function with arg '_PIPE_' and body 'expr'
  #2. Construct a call() to that function
  #3. Do the call

  f <- function( `_PIPE_`) NULL
  body( f) <- expr
  environment( f) <- parent.frame() # or something... yes these details are almost certainly wrong
  expr2 <- substitute( f( `_PIPE_`)) # or something...
  eval.parent( expr2) # or something... 
}

Subject: Re: [Rd] New pipe operator

I understand very well that it is implemented at the syntax level;
however, in any case the implementation is irrelevant to the principles.

Here a similar example to the one I gave before but this time written out:

This works:

  3 |> function(x) x + 1

but this does not:

  foo <- function(x) x + 1
  3 |> foo

so it breaks the principle of functions being first class objects.  foo and its
definition are not interchangeable.  You have
to write 3 |> foo() but don't have to write 3 |> (function(x) x + 1)().

This isn't just a matter of notation, i.e. foo vs foo(), but is a
matter of breaking
the way R works as a functional language with first class functions.

Thanks, Duncan. That answers my question fairly definitively.

Although it can be DONE it likely won't be for the reasons Hadley mentioned until we get some other product that replaces it entirely. There are some interesting work-arounds mentioned. 

I was thinking of one that has overhead but might be a pain. Hadley mentioned a slight variant. The first argument to a function now is expected to be the data argument. The second might be the mapping. Now if the function is called with a new first argument that is a ggplot object, it could be possible to test the type and if it is a ggplot object than slide over carefully any additional matched arguments that were not explicitly named. Not sure that is at all easy to do.

Alternately, you can ask that when used in such a pipeline that the user call all other arguments using names like data=whatever, mapping=aes(whatever) so no other args need to be adjusted by position.

But all this is academic and I concede will likely not be done. I can live with the plus signs.

Hadley's answer (#7 here: 
https://community.rstudio.com/t/why-cant-ggplot2-use/4372) makes it pretty clear that he thinks it would have been nice now if he had made that choice when ggplot2 came out, but it's not worth the effort now to change it.

Nothing much happens till the object is implicitly or explicitly given to print() which switches to the print function for objects of that type and creates a graph based on the contents of the object at that time. So, in theory, you could have a pipelined version of ggplot where the first function accepts something like a  data.frame or tibble as the default first argument and at the end returns the object we have been describing. All additional functions would then accept such an object as the (hidden?) first argument and return the modified object. The final function in the pipe would either have the value captured in a variable for later use or print implicitly generating a graph.

As someone used to magrittr's data pipelines, I will play with this base one before making up my mind. I don't expect its behavior to be exactly like magrittr "%>%" (and it's not). For the moment all I can say is that it is something R users are used to and that it now avoids loading a package.

I understood what you meant as well.

The issue is that neither foo nor its definition are being operated on, or
even exist within the scope of what |> is defined to do. You are used to
magrittr's %>% where arguably what you are saying would be true. But its
not here, in my view.

Again, I think the issue is that |>, in as much as it "operates" on
anything at all (it not being a function, regardless of appearances),
operates on call expression objects, NOT on functions, ever.

function(x) x *parses to a call expression *as does RHSfun(), while RHSfun does
not, it parses to a name, *regardless of whether that symbol will
eventually evaluate to a closure or not.*

So in fact, it seems to me that, technically, all name symbols are being
treated exactly the same (none are allowed, including those which will
lookup to functions during evaluation), while all* call expressions are
also being treated the same. And again, there are no functions anywhere in
either case.

* except those that include that the parser flags as syntactically special.

I think you should probably be careful what you wish for here. I'm not
involved with this work and do not speak for any of those who were, but the
principled way to make that consistent while remaining entirely in the
parser seems very likely to be to require the latter, rather than not
require the former.

I don't agree. Consider `+`

Having

foo <- get("+") ## note no `` here
foo(x,y)

parse and work correctly while

+(x,y)

 does not does not mean + isn't a function or that it is a "second class
citizen", it simply means that the parser has constraints on the syntax for
writing code that calls it that calling other functions are not subject to.
The fact that such *syntactic* constraints can exist proves that there is
not some overarching inviolable principle being violated here, I think. Now
you may say "well thats just the parser, it has to parse + specially
because its an operator with specific precedence etc". Well, the same exact
thing is true of |> I think.

Best,
~G

I'm not involved with this work and do not speak for any of those who were, but the principled way to make that consistent while remaining entirely in the parser seems very likely to be to require the latter, rather than not require the former.

The fact that such syntactic constraints can exist proves that there is not some overarching inviolable principle being violated here, I think. Now you may say "well thats just the parser, it has to parse + specially because its an operator with specific precedence etc". Well, the same exact thing is true of |> I think.

I believe there's no ambiguity if the placeholder is *only* allowed in  
the RHS of a pipe expression.  I think the ambiguity arises if you allow  
the same syntax to be used to generate anonymous functions.  We can't  
use _PIPE_ as the placeholder, because it's a legal name.  But we could  
use _.  Then

   x |> (_ + 1) + mean(_)

could expand unambiguously to

   (function(_) (_  + 1) + mean(_))(x)

but

   (_ + 1) + mean(_)

shouldn't be taken to be an anonymous function declaration, otherwise  
things like

   mean(_ |> _)

do become ambiguous:  is the second placeholder the argument to the anon  
function, or is it the placeholder for the embedded pipe?

However, implementing this makes the parser pretty ugly:  its handling  
of _ depends on the outer context.  I now agree that leaving out  
placeholder syntax was the right decision.

Yours would suffer one of the same problems as magrittr's:  it has the  
wrong operator precedence.  The current precedence ordering (from  
?Syntax) is, from highest to lowest:


:: :::	access variables in a namespace
$ @	component / slot extraction
[ [[	indexing
^	exponentiation (right to left)
- +	unary minus and plus
:	sequence operator
%any%	special operators (including %% and %/%)
* /	multiply, divide
+ -	(binary) add, subtract
< > <= >= == !=	ordering and comparison
!	negation
& &&	and
| ||	or
~	as in formulae
-> ->>	rightwards assignment
<- <<-	assignment (right to left)
=	assignment (right to left)
?	help (unary and binary)


The %>% operator has higher precedence than the arithmetic operators, so

x*y %>% f()

is equivalent to x*f(y), not

f(x*y)

as it should "obviously" be.  I believe the new |> operator falls  
between "| ||" and "~", so

x || y |> f()

is the same as f(x || y), and

x ~ y |> f()

is x ~ f(y).   There could be arguments about where the new one appears  
(and there probably have been), but *clearly* magrittr's precedence is  
wrong, and yours would be too, because they are both fixed at the quite  
high precedence given to %any%.

I agree it's all about call expressions, but they aren't all being 
treated equally:

x |> f(...)

expands to f(x, ...), while

x |> `function`(...)

expands to `function`(...)(x).  This is an exception to the rule for 
other calls, but I think it's a justified one.

This admitted inconsistency is justified by what?  No argument has been
presented.  The justification seems to be implicitly driven by implementation
concerns at the expense of usability and language consistency.

Here is my last SO post using dplyr rewritten to use R 4.1 devel.  Seems
not too bad.  Was able to work around the placeholder for gsub by specifying
the arg names and used \(...)... elsewhere.  This does not address the
inconsistency discussed though.  I have indented by 2 spaced in case the
email wraps around.  The objective is to read myfile.csv including columns that
contain c(...) and integer(0), parsing and evaluating them.

Or, keeping dplyr but with R-devel pipe and function shorthand:

DF <- "myfile.csv" %>%
    readLines() |>
    \(.) gsub(r'{(c\(.*?\)|integer\(0\))}', r'{"\1"}', .) |>
    \(.) read.csv(text = .) |>
    mutate(across(2:3, \(col) lapply(col, \(x) eval(parse(text = x)))))

Using named arguments to redirect to the implicit first does work,
also in magrittr, but for me at least it is the kind of thing I would
probably regret a month later when trying to figure out the code.

Best,

luke

Sorry if I have missed something, but is your consistency argument
basically that if

foo <- function(x) x + 1

then

x |> foo
x |> function(x) x + 1

should both work the same? Suppose it did. Would you then be OK if

x |> foo()

no longer worked as it does now, and produced foo()(x) instead of foo(x)?

If you are not OK with that and want to retain the current behaviour,
what would you want to happen with the following?

bar <- function(x) function(n) rnorm(n, mean = x)

10 |> bar(runif(1))() # works 'as expected' ~ bar(runif(1))(10)
10 |> bar(runif(1)) # currently bar(10, runif(1))

both of which you probably want. But then

baz <-  bar(runif(1))
10 |> baz

(not currently allowed) will not be the same as what you would want from

10 |> bar(runif(1))

which leads to a different kind of inconsistency, doesn't it?

One could examine how magrittr works as a reference implementation if
there is a question on how something should function.  It's in
widespread use and seems to work well.

Yes, but it has many inconsistencies (including for the example I
gave). Do you want a magrittr clone, or do you want consistency? It's
OK to want either, but I don't think you can get both.

What we actually end up with is another matter, depending on many
other factors. I was just trying to understand your consistency
argument.

Hmm,

I feel a bit bad coming late to this, but I think I am beginning to side with those who want  "... |> head" to work. And yes, that has to happen at the expense of |> head().

As I think it was Gabor points out, the current structure goes down a nonstandard evaluation route, which may be difficult to explain and departs from usual operator evaluation paradigms by being an odd mix of syntax and semantics. R lets you do these sorts of thing, witness ggplot and tidyverse, but the transparency of the language tends to suffer. 

It would be neater if it was simply so that the class/type of the object on the right hand side decided what should happen. So we could have a rule that we could have an object, an expression, and possibly an unevaluated call on the RHS. Or maybe a formula, I.e., we could have

... |> head

but not  

... |> head() 

because head() does not evaluate to anything useful. Instead, we could have some of these

... |> quote(head())
... |> expression(head())
... |> ~ head()
... |> \(_) head(_)

possibly also using a placeholder mechanism for the three first ones. I kind of like the idea that the ~ could be equivalent to \(_).

(And yes, I am kicking myself a bit for not using ~ in the NSE arguments in subset() and transform())

The gsub issue suggests that if one were to start afresh
that the arguments to gsub (and many other R functions)
should be rearranged.  Of course, that is precisely what
the tidyverse did.

Just curious, how would you express head(df, 10)?  Currently it is

  df |> head(10)

Would I have to write it as

  df |> function(d) head(d, 10)

I wouldn't call it non-standard evaluation.  There is no function 
corresponding to |>, so there's no evaluation at all.  It is more like 
the way "x -> y" is parsed as "y <- x", or "if (x) y" is transformed to 
`if`(x, y).

Subject: [Rd] anonymous functions
Message-ID: <28fddd$f2ifur@ironport10.mayo.edu>

?The shorthand form \(x) x + 1 is parsed as function(x) x + 1. It may be helpful in making 
code containing simple function expressions more readable.?

Color me unimpressed.
Over the decades I've seen several "who can write the shortest code" threads: in Fortran, 
in C, in Splus, ...   The same old idea that "short" is a synonym for either elegant, 
readable, or efficient is now being recylced in the tidyverse.   The truth is that "short" 
is actually an antonym for all of these things, at least for anyone else reading the code; 
or for the original coder 30-60 minutes after the "clever" lines were written.  Minimal 
use of the spacebar and/or the return key isn't usually held up as a goal, but creeps into 
many practiioner's code as well.

People are excited by replacing "function(" with "\("?  Really?   Are people typing code 
with their thumbs?
I am ambivalent about pipes: I think it is a great concept, but too many of my colleagues 
think that using pipes = no need for any comments.

As time goes on, I find my goal is to make my code less compact and more readable.  Every 
bug fix or new feature in the survival package now adds more lines of comments or other 
documentation than lines of code.  If I have to puzzle out what a line does, what about 
the poor sod who inherits the maintainance?

My vote is for the consistency of function calls always having parentheses,
including in pipes.  Making them optional only saves two keystrokes, but
will add yet another inconsistency to confuse or trip folks up.

As for the new anonymous function syntax, I would prefer something more
human friendly, perhaps provide ?fun? as a shortcut for ?function?,
enabling:

DF <- "myfile.csv" %>%
    readLines() |>
    fun(x) gsub(r'{(c\(.*?\)|integer\(0\))}', r'{"\1"}', x) |>
    fun(x) read.csv(text = x)|>
   mutate(
        across(2:3,
              fun(col) lapply(col,
                   fun(x) eval(parse(text = x))
              )
        )
   )

which seems much easier to read and understand, at the cost of only a few
extra characters.

It could be 

df |> ~ head(_, 10)

which in a sense is "yes" to your question.

That's a point, but maybe also my point. Currently, the parser is inserting the LHS as the 1st argument of the RHS, right? Things might be simpler if it was more like a simple binop.

I don't disagree in principle, but the reality is users want shortcuts
and as a result various packages, in particular tidyverse, have been
providing them. Mostly based on formulas, mostly with significant
issues since formulas weren't designed for this, and mostly
incompatible (tidyverse ones are compatible within tidyverse but not
with others). And of course none work in sapply or lapply. Providing a
shorthand in base may help to improve this. You don't have to use it
if you don't want to, and you can establish coding standards that
disallow it if you like.

Best,

luke

But you didn't "always" include parentheses, you skipped them on the 
calls to the anonymous functions.  I think that's the one place I'd make 
the exception, so maybe we agree:  parens are almost always needed, with 
the sole exception being anonymous functions.

As to using "fun", I think that's a bad idea.  I haven't checked, but I 
wouldn't be too surprised if "fun" has been used thousands of times in 
CRAN packages as the name of a function.  So

  x |> fun(y)

would mean "fun(x, y)", whereas

  x |> fun(y) y+1

would mean (function(y) y+1)(x).

I think that's doing too much weird stuff.  I wouldn't want to have to 
teach it to beginners, whereas I think I could teach "df |> head(10)". 
That's doing one weird thing, but I'd count about three things I'd 
consider weird in yours.

An advantage of the current implementation is that it's simple and easy 
to understand.  Once you make it a user-modifiable binary operator, 
things will go kind of nuts.

For example, I doubt if there are many users of magrittr's pipe who 
really understand its subtleties, e.g. the example in Luke's paper where 
1 %>% c(., 2) gives c(1,2), but 1 %>% c(c(.), 2) gives c(1, 1, 2). (And 
I could add 1 %>% c(c(.), 2, .) and  1 %>% c(c(.), 2, . + 2)  to 
continue the fun.)

It can only be a simple binop if you only allow RHS functions of one argument.
Which would require currying along the lines Duncan showed. Something like:

`%>>%` <- function(x, f) f(x)
C1 <- function(f, ...) function(x) f(x, ...)

mtcars %>>% head
mtcars %>>% C1(head, 2)
mtcars %>>% C1(subset, cyl == 4) %>>% \(d) lm(mpg ~ disp, data = d)

This might fly if we lived in a world where most RHS functions take
one argument and only a few needed currying. That is the case in many
functional languages, but not for R. Making the common case of
multiple arguments easy means you have to work at the source level,
either in the parser or with some form of NSE.

Best,

luke

It is easier to understand a function if you can see the entire
function body at once on a page or screen and excessive verbosity
interferes with that.

Luke,
 ? Mostly an aside.? I think that pipes are a good addition, and it is clear that you and 
other R-core thought through many of the details.?? Congratulations on what appears to be 
solid work. I've used Unix since '79, so it is almost guarranteed that I like the basic 
idiom, and I expect to make use of it.? Users who think that pipes -- or any other code -- 
is so clear that comments are superfluous is no reflection on R core, and also a bit of a 
hobby horse for me.

I am a bit bemused by the flood of change suggestions, before people have had a chance to 
fully exercise the new code. ? I'd suggest waiting several months, or a year, before major 
updates, straight up bugs excepted. ? The same advice holds when moving into a new house.
One? experience with the survival package has been that most new ideas have been 
implemented locally, and we run with them for half a year before submission to CRAN.? I've 
had a few "really great" modifications that, thankfully, were never inflicted on the rest 
of the R community.

The rule is not so complicated.  Automatic insertion is done unless
you use dot in the top level function or if you surround it with
{...}.  It really makes sense since if you use gsub(pattern,
replacement, .) then surely you don't want automatic insertion and if
you surround it with { ... } then you are explicitly telling it not
to.

Assuming the existence of placeholders a possible simplification would
be to NOT do automatic insertion if { ... } is used and to use it
otherwise although personally having used it for some time I find the
existing rule in magrittr generally does what you want.

IMHO the use of anonymous functions is a very clean solution to the
placeholder problem, and the shorthand lambda syntax makes it much
more ergonomic to use. Pipe implementations that crawl the RHS for
usages of `.` are going to be more expensive than the alternatives. It
is nice that the `|>` operator is effectively the same as a regular R
function call, and given the identical semantics could then also be
reasoned about the same way regular R function calls are.

I also agree usages of the `.` placeholder can make the code more
challenging to read, since understanding the behavior of a piped
expression then requires scouring the RHS for usages of `.`, which can
be challenging in dense code. Piping to an anonymous function makes
the intent clear to the reader: the programmer is likely piping to an
anonymous function because they care where the argument is used in the
call, and so the reader of code should be aware of that.

Best,
Kevin

Subject: [Rd] sequential chained operator thoughts
References: <061f01d6cccd$0c25e3a0$2471aae0$.ref@verizon.net>
Message-ID: <061f01d6cccd$0c25e3a0$2471aae0$@verizon.net>

It has been very enlightening watching the discussion not only about the
existing and proposed variations of a data "pipe" operator in R but also
cognates in many other languages.

So I am throwing out a QUESTION that just asks if the pipeline as done is
pretty much what could also be done without the need for an operator using a
sort of one-time brac]keted  construct where you call a function with a
sequence of operations you want performed and just have it handle the
in-between parts.

I mean something like:

return_val <- do_chain_sequence( { initial_data,
				function1(_VAL_);
				function2(_VAL_, more_args);
				function3(args, 2 * _VAL_, more_args);
				...
				function_n(_VAL_)
				})

The above is not meant to be taken literally. I don't care if the symbol is
_VAL_ or you use semi-colon characters between statements. There are many
possible variants such as each step being in its own curly braces. The idea
is to hand over one or more unevaluated blocks of code. There are such
functions in use in R already.

And yes, it can be written with explicit BEFORE/AFTER clauses to handle
things but those are implementation details and I want to focus on a
concept.

The point is you can potentially write a function that given such a series
of arguments, delays evaluation of them until each is needed or used. About
all it might need to do is set the value of something like _VAL_ from the
first argument if present and then take the text of each subsequent argument
and run it while saving the result back into _VAL_ and at the end, return
the last _VAL_. Along the way, of course, the temporary values stored each
time in _VAL_ would disappear.

Is something like this any improvement over this done by the user:

Initial <- whatever
Temp1 <- function1(initial)
Temp2 <- function2(Temp1, ...)
rm(Temp1)
...

Well, maybe not much. But it does hide some details and allows you to insert
or delete steps without worrying about pesky details like variable names
being in the right sequence or not over-riding other things in your
namespace. It makes your intent clear.

Now obviously being evaluated inside a function is not necessarily the same
as remaining in the original environment so having something like this as a
built-in running in place might be a better idea.

I admit the details of how to get one piece at a time as some unevaluated
form and recognize clearly what each piece is takes some careful thought. If
you want to automatically throw in a first argument of _VAL_ after the first
parenthesis found or inserted in new parens if just the name of a function
was presented,  or other such manipulations as already seem to happen with
the Magritrr pipe where a period is the placeholder, that can be delicate
work and also fail for some lines of code.  There may be many reasons
various versions of this proposal can fail for some cases. But functionally,
it would be a way to specify in a linear fashion that a sequence of steps is
to be connected with data being passed along as it changes.

I can also imagine how this kind of method might allow twists like asking
for _VAL_$second or other changes such as sorted(_VAL_) or minmax(_VAL_)
that would shrink the sequence.

This general idea looks like something that some programming language may
already do in some form and functionally and is a bit like the pipe idea,
albeit with different overhead.

And do note many languages already support this in subtle ways. R has a
variable called ".Last.value" that always holds the result of the last
statement evaluated. If the template above is used properly, that alone
might work, albeit be a bit wordy. But it may be more transient in some
cases such as a multi-part statement where it ends up being reset within the
statement.

I am NOT asking for a new feature in R, or any language. I am just asking if
the various pipeline ideas  used could be done in a general way like I
describe as a sequence where the statements are chained as described and
intermediate results are transient. But, yes, some implementations might
require some changes to the language to be implemented properly and it might
not satisfy people used to thinking a certain way.

I end by saying that R is a language that only returns one (sometimes
complex) return value. Other languages allow multiple return values and
pipelines there might be hard to implement or have weird features that allow
various of the returns to be captured or even a more general graph of
command sequences  rather than just a linear pipeline. My thoughts here are
for R alone. And I shudder at what happens if you allow exceptions and other
kinds of breaks/returns out of such a sequential grouping in mid-stride. I
view most such additions and changes as needing careful thought to make sure
they have the functionality most people want, are as consistent as possible
with the existing language, and do not have lots of potential for bugs or
bad programs or ones very hard to read and understand.

You wouldn't have to crawl the expression.  This does it at the syntax level.

One advantage of the new pipe operator over magrittr's is that the former
works with substitute().
> f <- function(x, xlab=deparse1(substitute(x))) paste(sep="", xlab, ": ",
paste(collapse=", ",x))
> 2^(1:4)  |> f()
[1] "2^(1:4): 2, 4, 8, 16"
> 2^(1:4)  %>% f()
[1] ".: 2, 4, 8, 16"

This is because the new one is at the parser level, so f() sees an ordinary
function call.

f(2^(1:4))

This is the point that I believe Duncan is trying to make (and I agree
with) though. Consider the question "after piping LHS into RHS, what is the
first argument in the resulting call?".

For the base pipe, the answer, completely unambiguously, is LHS. Full stop.
That is easy to understand.

For magrittr the answer is "Well, it depends, let me see your RHS
expression, is it wrapped in braces? If not, are you using the placeholder?
If you are using the placeholder, where/how are you using it?".

That is inherently much more complicated. Yes, you understand how the
magrittr pipe behaves, and yes you find it very convenient. Thats great,
but neither of those things equate to simplicity. They just mean that you,
a very experienced pipe user, carry around the cognitive load necessary to
have that understanding.

More concretely, the current base pipe  is extremely simple, all it does i


   1. Figure out RHS exprssion call
         1. If RHS is an anonymous function declaration, construct a call
         to it for a new RHS
      2. Insert LHS expression into first argument position of RHS call
      expression


Done. And (1) would be removed if anonymous functions required () after
them, which would be consistent, and even simpler, but kind of annoying. I
think it is a good compromise which is guaranteed to be safe because
anonymous functions are something the parser recognizes.  Either way, if
that was dropped, what |> does would be *entirely* trivial to understand
and explain. With a single sentence.

I had the equivalent pseudocode for the magrittr pipe written out here but
honestly felt like overkill that came across as mean, so I'll leave that as
an exercise to interested readers.

I agree. That said, one thing that maybe could be done, though I'm not
super convinced its needed, is make a "curry-stuffed pipe", where something
like

LHS |^pipearg^> RHS(arg1 = 5, arg3 = 7)

Would parse to

RHS(pipearg = LHS, arg1 = 5, arg3 = 7)


(Assuming we could get the parser to handle |^bla^> correctly)

For argument position issues would be sufficient. For more complicated
expressions, e.g., those that would use the placeholder multiple times or
inside compound expressions, requiring anonymous functions seems quite
reasonable to me. And honestly, while I kind of like it, I'm not sure if
that "stuffed pipe" expression (assuming we could get the parser to capture
it correctly) reads to me as nicer than the following, anyway.

This gave me the idea that naming the arguments can be used to skip the 
placeholder issue:

"funny" |> sub(pattern = "f", replacement = "b")

Of course this breaks if the maintainer changes the order of the 
function arguments (which is not a nice practice but happens).

An option could be to allow for missing argument in the first position, 
but this might add further undesired complexity, so probably not worth 
the effort:

"funny" |> sub(x =, "f", "b")

So basically the parsing rule would be:

LHS |> RHS(arg=, ...)     -> RHS(arg=LHS, ...)

I mostly agree with your comments on anonymous functions.

However, I think the main problem is cryptic-ness, rather than succinct-ness.
The backslash is a relatively universal symbol within programming
languages with C-like (ALGOL-like?) syntax.
Where it denotes escape sequences within strings.

Using the leading character for escape sequences, to define functions,
is like using integers to define floating point numbers:

    my.integer <- as.integer (2) * pi

Arguably, the motive is more to be ultra-succinct than cryptic.
But either way, we get syntax which is difficult to read, from a
mathematical and statistical perspective.

This is true, but only if you are specifying all arguments that appear
before the one you want explicitly. In practice that may often be true? But
I don't really have a strong intuition about that as a non-pipe user. It
would require zero changes to the pipe by the R-core team though, so in
that sense it could be a solution in the cases it does work. It does make
the code subtler to read though, which is a pretty big downside, imho.

The problem here is that its ambiguous, because myfun(x, y=, z) is
technically syntactically valid, so this would make code that parses now
into valid syntax change its meaning, and would prevent existing,
syntactically valid (Though hopefully quite rare) code in the pipe context.

Sorry, I should replace "cryptic-ness" from my last post, with
"unnecessary cryptic-ness".
Sometimes short symbolic expressions are necessary.


P.S.
Often, I wish I could write: f (x) = x^2.
But that's replacement function syntax.

I will stick my oar in here as a user to say that I find the \(x) syntax a bit line-noise-ish.

Here's a suggestion to let people define their own shorthands and work 
with the current |> definition.

Define "as.call" as an S3 generic, with a default definition something like

as.call.default <- function(x, f, ...) f(x, ...)

so one could use

  x |> as.call(mean)

to get the same result as

  x |> mean()

or (if working in the tidyverse)

  x |> as.call(~ .x + 1)

to use a method to be provided by rlang or purrr to convert their 
shorthand into a call that the pipe can work with.

We already have the generic as.function, which could be used internally 
by lapply and sapply for the same sort of purpose.  tidyverse has 
rlang::as_function, so they could pretty easily add methods for 
as.function if they wanted to allow people to use their shorthand in 
*apply functions.

Yes, this is the problem.  It is trying to handle two different sorts of right
hand sides, calls and functions, using only syntax level operations and
it really needs to either make use of deeper information or have some
method that is available at the syntax level for identifying whether the
right hand side is a call or function.  In the latter case having two
operators would be one way to do it.

  f <- \(x) x + 1
  x |> f()  # call
  x |:> f  # function
  x |:> \(x) x + 1  # function

In the other case where deeper information is used there would only be one
operator and it would handle all cases but would use more than just syntax
level knowledge.

R solved these sorts of problems long ago using S3 and other object oriented
systems which dispatch different methods based on what the right hand side is.
The attempt to avoid using the existing or equivalent mechanisms seems to have
led to this problem.

I just wanted to pipe in here (HA HA) to say that I agree with Kevin.
I've never loved the complicated magrittr rule (which has personally
tripped me up a couple of times) and I think the compact inline
function syntax provides a more general solution. It is a bit more
typing, and it will require a little time for your eyes to get used to
the new syntax, but overall I think it's a better solution.

In general, I think the base pipe does an excellent job of taking what
we've learned from 6 years of magrittr, keeping what has been most
successful while discarding complications around the edges.

That's probably a bad choice of name for the generic in that it doesn't 
convert x to a call and it's only useful in a pipe, but I do think the 
idea of some generic function would be useful.

The formulas as functions in the gsubfn package work with nearly any function
including sapply and lapply.

It still seems to me that placeholders are viable and unambiguous (only as things in RHS of pipes), and that something like  

x |> foo( _PIPE_) 
x |> bah( otherarg, _PIPE_)
x |> { y <- _PIPE_+1; _PIPE_ / y } # anonymous function

would be a viable solution that doesn't break syntax. This suggestion expands slightly on my previous post, to deal with anonymous functions without either ugly or cumbersome syntax. Specifically, the parser could expand curly-braces in a pipe RHS like this:

x |> {expr} 

into

_ANON_( _PIPE_, {expr})( x)

where '_ANON_' itself  constructs-and-calls a function with one argument called '_PIPE_' whose body consists of 'expr' (which presumably refers to '_PIPE_')

No new weird operators like \(, and the only break with normal syntax is the expansion of curly-braces--- plus treating one symbol, _PIPE_ or any other pre-agreed one perhaps even just _, as a legal name inside a pipe.

Now back to my previous post and responding to Duncan's comments:

and (see end) I think the line with _ANON_ above could in fact just be

  ... |> { x <- sum( _PIPE_); _PIPE_/x + x/_PIPE_ }

Yes--- that's my suggestion: there and only there. Hence an otherwise-illegal name like _PIPE_.

Agreed; don't allow that outside of pipes.

> We can't use _PIPE_ as the placeholder, because it's a legal name.

Surely _PIPE_ is not a legal R name though? Not in my R4.1.0dev, anyway. Of course, the parser can _make_ it legal *only* in the context of RHS of pipe. Anyway, I'm not suggesting the names must be _PIPE_ and _ANON_--- the name is secondary to the concept.

> But we could use _.  

Yes, any unclashable name would do--- though "_" is hard to read (as per complaints about "." as placeholder, which I use in my own code). And I remember back when R decided to disallow "_" as an assignment operator. Which forced me to change about 50000 lines of code that wasn't stored in text files, so I wasn't happy--- and the only reason that was ever given to me, was "it's ugly" ! Which is kinda true.

> However, implementing this makes the parser pretty ugly: its handling of _ depends on the outer context.  

That context issue is already the case under the current proposal though; eg 'head(10)' in 

x |> head(10) # really head( <arg>, 10)

or indeed 'head' in 

x |> head # actually a call to head(<arg>), not a symbol


> I now agree that leaving out placeholder syntax was the right decision.

Others are not so sure!

Re operator precedence: thanks for pointing that out, I accept that R's current operator-precedence rules make it impossible for people to cleanly implement their own preferred homemade %my_pipe_op%.

All the more reason to be careful with the pipe syntax choice for base-R, of course...

That wouldn't be allowed in my proposal; the "_ |> _" is illegal because the RHS is not a call. For the whole thing, I'd require

x |> _ANON_((_PIPE_ + 1) + mean( _PIPE_))

or the just-curly version

x |> { (_PIPE_ + 1) + mean( _PIPE_)} 

but with the implication that this would parse out to 

(`_ANON_`( { (_PIPE_ + 1) + mean( _PIPE_)}))( x)

I believe there's no ambiguity if the placeholder is *only* allowed in
the RHS of a pipe expression.  I think the ambiguity arises if you allow
the same syntax to be used to generate anonymous functions.  We can't
use _PIPE_ as the placeholder, because it's a legal name.  But we could
use _.  Then

   x |> (_ + 1) + mean(_)

could expand unambiguously to

   (function(_) (_  + 1) + mean(_))(x)

but

   (_ + 1) + mean(_)

shouldn't be taken to be an anonymous function declaration, otherwise
things like

   mean(_ |> _)

do become ambiguous:  is the second placeholder the argument to the anon
function, or is it the placeholder for the embedded pipe?

However, implementing this makes the parser pretty ugly:  its handling
of _ depends on the outer context.  I now agree that leaving out
placeholder syntax was the right decision.

Yours would suffer one of the same problems as magrittr's:  it has the
wrong operator precedence.  The current precedence ordering (from
?Syntax) is, from highest to lowest:


:: :::  access variables in a namespace
$ @     component / slot extraction
[ [[    indexing
^       exponentiation (right to left)
- +     unary minus and plus
:       sequence operator
%any%   special operators (including %% and %/%)
* /     multiply, divide
+ -     (binary) add, subtract
< > <= >= == != ordering and comparison
!       negation
& &&    and
| ||    or
~       as in formulae
-> ->>  rightwards assignment
<- <<-  assignment (right to left)
=       assignment (right to left)
?       help (unary and binary)


The %>% operator has higher precedence than the arithmetic operators, so

x*y %>% f()

is equivalent to x*f(y), not

f(x*y)

as it should "obviously" be.  I believe the new |> operator falls
between "| ||" and "~", so

x || y |> f()

is the same as f(x || y), and

x ~ y |> f()

is x ~ f(y).   There could be arguments about where the new one appears
(and there probably have been), but *clearly* magrittr's precedence is
wrong, and yours would be too, because they are both fixed at the quite
high precedence given to %any%.

First, one comment:

You're right about the illegality of _PIPE_ as a name, I had  
misremembered the rule.

About your proposal:

I don't find it attractive, but I can see that some people would.  But I  
don't think it's necessary to put it into the base parser.  Other than  
using an illegal name, there doesn't seem to be a reason you couldn't  
write a small function to convert your placeholder proposal to a call to  
a function.  So instead of typing

  x |> { y <- _PIPE_+1; _PIPE_ / y }

you would type

  x |> forpipe({ y <- PIPE_+1; PIPE_ / y })

I don't think "forpipe" is the right name here.  I proposed a generic  
"as.call" before, but I don't like that one either.  I'm still trying to  
think of a good name, and whether or not it makes sense for it to be  
generic.

But the point is that we don't need to choose just one from all the  
proposed replacements for anonymous function syntax, we can try them out  
and see which ones we like.  We might end up with more than one (like we  
have at least 4 different high level graphics paradigms!), and that's  
not the end of the world.

And I remember back when R decided to disallow "_" as an assignment operator. Which forced me to change about 50000 lines of code that wasn't stored in text files, so I wasn't happy--- and the only reason that was ever given to me, was "it's ugly" ! Which is kinda true.

Good day,

Could .libPaths gain an option to ignore all values other than the user-specified new parameter? Currently, it takes the union of new and .Library and .Library.site and there is no way to turn it off. For quick and convenient troubleshooting that doesn't involve requiring the editing of configuration files, it would be nice to be able to run .libPaths(.libPaths()[1], ignoreSiteFiles = TRUE) to limit to only one folder of R packages.

Hi Dario,

My switchr package is designed specifically to do what you're describing,
and does support excluding site libraries. So clearly I agree it would be
useful, but also, it does go against the "concept" of site libraries
somewhat.

I agree it would be a useful addition with the default to including them,
personally. And the patch would be pretty easy to put together. I can put
together a patch and add it to bugzilla as a wishlist item and we'll see
what thoughts are (unless I hear an emphatic no here, in which case I won't
bother, or unless you'd like to take a crack at it yourself).

Are you use? It is constructed from looking at environment variables you could set.

Of course you can, but the ability to do something via R code and the
ability to do them by wrapping the invocation of R are not similar terms of
convenience, IMO.

I say that as someone who routinely does both type of thing.

Good day,

That seems like a straightforward and reasonable thing to do, but:

~$ R_LIBS="/tmp" R_LIBS_SITE="/var" Rscript -e 'print(.libPaths())'
[1] "/dora/nobackup/biostat/Rpackages/v4" "/dora/users/course/splus/library/R" 
[3] "/usr/lib/R/site-library"             "/usr/lib/R/library"

/tmp and /var exist of course.

Hm. Maybe you have code in RHOME/etc/* or in HOME to set some of these?

The (very detailed) description of what happens when is in help(Startup)
which is a great resource but as dense as they get. My example came from my
Ubuntu 20.04 box where I set nothing apart from not using a ~/R/ path.

Also try "R -q -e 'print(.libPaths())'" with these switches to narrow it down:

  --no-environ          Don't read the site and user environment files
  --no-site-file        Don't read the site-wide Rprofile                 
  --no-init-file        Don't read the user R profile

| /tmp and /var exist of course.

Right, I didn't stress that but the choice made it clear.  I still think you
should be able to tune this with just base R.

Cheers, Dirk

Right, yes. Actually that was part of my first email: I had

x |> _ANON_({ y <- _PIPE_+1; _PIPE_ / y })

I deliberately picked otherwise-illegal names, to prevent extrapipular abuse, but that's not a big deal. Second email gives that option as well as curly-brace version.

It's true that there's no *need* to change the base parser in order to get the functionality of your 'forpipe' / my '_ANON_'--- but pipes are really about convenience, so "need" becomes quite subjective; perhaps the curly-brace version, or something else, is attractive enough to warrant it (I don't know). And it seems like the new pipe-aware parser is already having to deal differently with expressions inside a pipe vs outside.

However, I was also discussing non-anonymous function calls in pipes, and arguing that they should require (or at least be able to use) a reserved-word placeholder (PIPE_ or whatever)--- EG

x |> match( LETTERS, _PIPE_) # non-first arg

So that's a separate part of my proposal.

If I was king I actually wouldn't let people do

x |> head

and would force them instead to do 

x |> head( _PIPE_)

but, clearly, I am not.

Good point. Multiple options is no disaster, and experiments are excellent--- though once things get embedded in R, it's hard to pull them out... 

However, aren't we limited to experimenting within the confines of the current pipe-aware parser? Many of the suggestions on this topic seem to go beyond that (including mine). EG I *think*, subject to correction, that

 - you're right that 'forpipe'/'_ANON_' can be implemented to work with the current pipe-aware parser
 
 - But, the curly-brace version would require a parser change
 
 - and the use of a reserved-word placeholder also isn't possible as-is
 
If there's some way to try those things out, it would be great.

Subject: Re: [Rd] New pipe operator

First, one comment:

You're right about the illegality of _PIPE_ as a name, I had
misremembered the rule.

About your proposal:

I don't find it attractive, but I can see that some people would.  But I
don't think it's necessary to put it into the base parser.  Other than
using an illegal name, there doesn't seem to be a reason you couldn't
write a small function to convert your placeholder proposal to a call to
a function.  So instead of typing

  x |> { y <- _PIPE_+1; _PIPE_ / y }

you would type

  x |> forpipe({ y <- PIPE_+1; PIPE_ / y })

I don't think "forpipe" is the right name here.  I proposed a generic
"as.call" before, but I don't like that one either.  I'm still trying to
think of a good name, and whether or not it makes sense for it to be
generic.

But the point is that we don't need to choose just one from all the
proposed replacements for anonymous function syntax, we can try them out
and see which ones we like.  We might end up with more than one (like we
have at least 4 different high level graphics paradigms!), and that's
not the end of the world.

And I remember back when R decided to disallow "_" as an assignment operator. Which forced me to change about 50000 lines of code that wasn't stored in text files, so I wasn't happy--- and the only reason that was ever given to me, was "it's ugly" ! Which is kinda true.

I agree with Gabe here.
Also, R allows the user to remove their own home directory, it
should also allow to get a .libPaths() which contains nothing compulsory
but R's own .Library {as only that can contain 'base' !}

Message-ID: <CAGBtDS-ZS_35QnJnPqW_fHaJF-LaWo8iPhOaTssyVTCU=q7dSw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm a data scientist who routinely uses R in my day-to-day work, for tasks
such as cleaning and transforming data, exploratory data analysis, etc.
This includes frequent use of the pipe operator from the magrittr and dplyr
libraries, %>%.  So, I was pleased to hear about the recent work on a
native pipe operator, |>.

This seems like a good time to bring up the main pain point I encounter
when using pipes in R, and some suggestions on what could be done about
it.  The issue is that the pipe operator can't be placed at the start of a
line of code (except in parentheses).  That's no different than any binary
operator in R, but I find it's a source of difficulty for the pipe because
of how pipes are often used.

[I'm assuming here that my usage is fairly typical of a lot of users; at
any rate, I don't think I'm *too* unusual.]

=== Why this is a problem ===

It's very common (for me, and I suspect for many users of dplyr) to write
multi-step pipelines and put each step on its own line for readability.
Something like this:

  ### Example 1 ###
  my_data_frame_1 %>%
    filter(some_conditions_1) %>%
    inner_join(my_data_frame_2, by = some_columns_1) %>%
    group_by(some_columns_2) %>%
    summarize(some_aggregate_functions_1) %>%
    filter(some_conditions_2) %>%
    left_join(my_data_frame_3, by = some_columns_3) %>%
    group_by(some_columns_4) %>%
    summarize(some_aggregate_functions_2) %>%
    arrange(some_columns_5)

[I guess some might consider this an overly long pipeline; for me it's
pretty typical.  I *could* split it up by assigning intermediate results to
variables, but much of the value I get from the pipe is that it lets my
code communicate which results are temporary, and which will be used again
later.  Assigning variables for single-use results would remove that
expressiveness.]

I would prefer (for reasons I'll explain) to be able to write the above
example like this, which isn't valid R:

  ### Example 2 (not valid R) ###
  my_data_frame_1
    %>% filter(some_conditions_1)
    %>% inner_join(my_data_frame_2, by = some_columns_1)
    %>% group_by(some_columns_2)
    %>% summarize(some_aggregate_functions_1)
    %>% filter(some_conditions_2)
    %>% left_join(my_data_frame_3, by = some_columns_3)
    %>% group_by(some_columns_4)
    %>% summarize(some_aggregate_functions_2)
    %>% arrange(some_columns_5)

One (minor) advantage is obvious: It lets you easily line up the pipes,
which means that you can see at a glance that the whole block is a single
pipeline, and you'd immediately notice if you inadvertently omitted a pipe,
which otherwise can lead to confusing output.  [It's also aesthetically
pleasing, especially when %>% is replaced with |>, but that's subjective.]

But the bigger issue happens when I want to re-run just *part* of the
pipeline.  I do this often when debugging: if the output of the pipeline
seems wrong, I re-run the first few steps and check the output, then
include a little more and re-run again, etc., until I locate my mistake.
Working in an interactive notebook environment, this involves using the
cursor to select just the part of the code I want to re-run.

It's fast and easy to select *entire* lines of code, but unfortunately with
the pipes placed at the end of the line I must instead select everything
*except* the last three characters of the line (the last two characters for
the new pipe).  Then when I want to re-run the same partial pipeline with
the next line of code included, I can't just press SHIFT+Down to select it
as I otherwise would, but instead must move the cursor horizontally to a
position three characters before the end of *that* line (which is generally
different due to varying line lengths).  And so forth each time I want to
include an additional line.

Moreover, with the staggered positions of the pipes at the end of each
line, it's very easy to accidentally select the final pipe on a line, and
then sit there for a moment wondering if the environment has stopped
responding before realizing it's just waiting for further input (i.e., for
the right-hand side).  These small delays and disruptions add up over the
course of a day.

This desire to select and re-run the first part of a pipeline is also the
reason why it doesn't suffice to achieve syntax like my "Example 2" by
wrapping the entire pipeline in parentheses.  That's of no use if I want to
re-run a selection that doesn't include the final close-paren.

=== Possible Solutions ===

I can think of two, but maybe there are others.  The first would make
"Example 2" into valid code, and the second would allow you to run a
selection that included a trailing pipe.

  Solution 1: Add a special case to how R is parsed, so if the first
(non-whitespace) token after an end-line is a pipe, that pipe gets moved to
before the end-line.
    - Argument for: This lets you write code like example 2, which
addresses the pain point around re-running part of a pipeline, and has
advantages for readability.  Also, since starting a line with a pipe
operator is currently invalid, the change wouldn't break any working code.
    - Argument against: It would make the behavior of %>% inconsistent with
that of other binary operators in R.  (However, this objection might not
apply to the new pipe, |>, which I understand is being implemented as a
syntax transformation rather than a binary operator.)

  Solution 2: Ignore the pipe operator if it occurs as the final token of
the code being executed.
    - Argument for: This would mean the user could select and re-run the
first few lines of a longer pipeline (selecting *entire* lines), avoiding
the difficulties described above.
    - Argument against: This means that %>% would be valid even if it
occurred without a right-hand side, which is inconsistent with other
operators in R.  (But, as above, this objection might not apply to |>.)
Also, this solution still doesn't enable the syntax of "Example 2", with
its readability benefit.

Thanks for reading this and considering it.

I'm not a pipe user, so I may be overlooking some issue, but wouldn't simply putting identity() on the last line solve your main problem?

### Example 1 ###
 my_data_frame_1 %>%
   filter(some_conditions_1) %>%
   inner_join(my_data_frame_2, by = some_columns_1) %>%
   group_by(some_columns_2) %>%
   summarize(some_aggregate_functions_1) %>%
   filter(some_conditions_2) %>%
   left_join(my_data_frame_3, by = some_columns_3) %>%
   group_by(some_columns_4) %>%
   summarize(some_aggregate_functions_2) %>%
   arrange(some_columns_5) %>%
   identity()

I agree that it would be visually more pleasing to have the pipe symbols lined up at the start of each line, but I don't think it's worth breaking R's principle of evaluating any line with a complete expression.

With your solution 1, R wouldn't be able to execute any complete command because it would have to wait and see if the next line happens to start with %>%.

With your solution 2, 
  
  my_data_frame_1 %>%

would be a complete expression (because an extra trailing %>% is allowed on the last line of a pipe) and hence execute immediately rather than wait for the next line.

Best,
Stefan

The requirement for operators at the end of the line comes from the 
interactive nature of R.  If you type

     my_data_frame_1

how could R know that you are not done, and are planning to type the 
rest of the expression

       %>% filter(some_conditions_1)
       ...

before it should consider the expression complete?  The way languages 
like C do this is by requiring a statement terminator at the end.  You 
can also do it by wrapping the entire thing in parentheses ().

However, be careful: Don't use braces:  they don't work.  And parens 
have the side effect of removing invisibility from the result (which is 
a design flaw or bonus, depending on your point of view).  So I actually 
wouldn't advise this workaround.

Insert one of the following into the pipeline. It does not require that you
edit any lines.   It only involves inserting a line.

  print %>%
  { str(.); . } %>%
  { . ->> .save } %>%

I think only allowing functions on the right hand side (e.g. only the |> 
operator and not the |:>) would be enough to handle most cases and seems 
easier to reason about. The limitations of that can easily be worked 
around using existing functionality in the language.

The problem with only allowing

x |> mean

and not

x |> mean()

is with additional arguments. However, this can be solved with a 
currying function, for example:

x |> curry(mean, na.rm = TRUE)

The cost is a few additional characters.

In the same way it is possible to write a function that accepts an 
expression and returns a function containing that expression. This can 
be used to have expressions on the right-hand side and reduces the need 
for anonymous functions.

x |> fexpr(. + 10)
dta |> fexpr(lm(y ~ x, data = .))

You could call this function .:

x |> .(. + 10)
dta |> .(lm(y ~ x, data = .))


Dummy example code (thanks to  a colleague of mine)


fexpr <- function(expr){
   expr <- substitute(expr)
   f <- function(.) {}
   body(f) <- expr
   f
}
. <- fexpr

curry <- function(fun,...){
   L <- list(...)
   function(...){
     do.call(fun, c(list(...),L))
   }
}

`%|>%` <- function(e1, e2) {
   e2(e1)
}


1:10 %>% mean
c(1,3,NA) %|>% curry(mean, na.rm = TRUE)
c(1,3,NA) %|>% .( mean(., na.rm = TRUE) ) %>% identity
c(1,3,NA) %|>% .( . + 4)
c(1,3,NA) %|>% fexpr( . + 4)
c(1,3,NA) %|>% function(x) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE) %>% fexpr(. + 1)

You might be interested in this blog post by Michael Barrowman:

He does some timing comparisons, and the current R-devel implementations 
of |> and \() do quite well.

I agree that would be sufficient, but I don't see how it makes reasoning 
easier.  The transformation is trivial, so I'll assume that doesn't 
consume any mental energy compared to understanding what the final 
expression actually does.  Using your currying example, the choice is 
between

  x |> mean(na.rm = TRUE)

which transforms to mean(x, na.rm = TRUE), or your proposed

  x |> curry(mean, na.rm = TRUE)

which transforms to

  curry(mean, na.rm = TRUE)(x)

To me curry(mean, na.rm = TRUE)(x) looks a lot more complicated than 
mean(x, na.rm = TRUE), especially since it has the additional risk that 
users can define their own function called "curry".

First, I do agree that

x |> mean(na.rm = TRUE)

is cleaner and this covers most of the use cases of users and many users 
are used to the syntax from the magritr pipes.

However, for programmers (there is not distinct line between users and 
programmers), it is simpler to reason in the sense that lhs |> rhs 
always mean rhs(lhs); this does not depend on whether rhs is call or 
(anonymous) function (not sure what is called what; which perhaps 
illustrates the difficulty).

As soon as you start to have functions returning functions, you have to 
think about how many brackets you have to place where. Being able to use 
functions returning functions does open up possibilities for 
programmers, as illustrated for example in my example using expressions. 
This would have been much less clear.

The argument of users begin able to redefine curry. Yes they can and 
this is perhaps a good thing. They can also redefine a lot of other 
stuff. And I am not suggesting that curry or fexpr or . are good names. 
You could even have a curry operator.

Best,
Jan

I think your proposed rule is pretty simple, with just one case:

lhs |> rhs

would transform to rhs(lhs).  Yes, that's simple.

The current rule is not as simple as yours, but it only has two cases 
instead of 1.  Both involve the rhs being a call, nothing else.

Case 1, the common one:  rhs is a call to a function using regular 
syntax, e.g. f(args) where args might be empty.  Then it is transformed 
to f(lhs, args).

Case 2:  rhs is a call to `function`, which we normally write as 
"function(args) body", which is transformed to (function(args) body)(lhs).

That's it!  Nothing else is allowed.  Not as simple as yours, but simple 
enough to be trivial to reason about.  Most of the effort would be spent 
in figuring out how the transformed expression would evaluate, and since 
your transformed expression is more complicated in the common case where 
currying is needed, I prefer the current proposal.

I think your examples would work in the current system, too, with a 
small change to fexpr.  A corresponding change to curry could be made, 
but then it wouldn't be doing currying, so I won't do that.  Here's your 
example rewritten in the R-devel system:

fexpr <- function(x, expr){
   expr <- substitute(expr)
   f <- function(.) {}
   body(f) <- expr
   f(x)
}
. <- fexpr


1:10 |> mean()
c(1,3,NA) |> mean(na.rm = TRUE)
c(1,3,NA) |> .( mean(., na.rm = TRUE) ) |> identity()
c(1,3,NA) |> .( . + 4)
c(1,3,NA) |> fexpr( . + 4)
c(1,3,NA) |> function(x) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE) |> fexpr(. + 1)

That produces the same outputs as your code.

It does bring out that the requirement of using functions to get around the
lack of placeholders is not free but exacts a small penalty in
terms of performance (in addition to verbosity).

The bizarro pipe supports placeholders and so doesn't require functions
as a workaround and thus would presumably be even faster.  It is also
perfectly consistent with the rest of R and requires no new syntax.
You have to explicitly add a dot as the first argument but this seems a better

I mean, technically, yes, but even with that overhead it's 2 *orders of
magnitude* faster than the magrittr you're used to, and by the look of it
~3x faster than the new magrittr. And, those base pipe speeds are in
microseconds. You'd have to be running that pipeline thousands of times -
which people don't generally do with pipelines in the first place -  to see
a *5 millisecond* slowdown, which you would then happily fail to notice
completely because what your pipeline is actually doing takes so much
longer than those microseconds of the extra function call that its unlikely
to be detectable at all.

I mean, I think the bizarro pipe was a pretty clever piece of work. I was

suggesting here. As you say, the bizarro pipe works now without any changes

It's about the entire R ecosystem and what gets used because it is in the base.

It would still be possible to implement \(x)... without |>  so I would
go with that and rethink
the pipe situation.

That would be a very nice-to-have feature! But right now, .libPaths() does
now allow this per my reading of the help page:

     ?.libPaths? is used for getting or setting the library trees that
     R knows about (and hence uses when looking for packages).  If
     called with argument ?new?, the library search path is set to the
     existing directories in ?unique(c(new, .Library.site, .Library))?
     and this is returned.  If given no argument, a character vector
     with the currently active library trees is returned.

Hence I was trying to help OP approximate the behaviour via the command-line
but count me in as in terms of supporting this in R itself if you want to
make such a change.

Since `+` is already a function we could do regular piping to change this code:

mtcars %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=wt, y=mpg)) +
  geom_point()

to this:

mtcars %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=wt, y=mpg)) %>%
  `+`(geom_point())

Further we can write wrapper functions like:

p_geom_point <- function(x,...) {
  x + geom_point(...)
}

The run the code like:

mtcars %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=wt, y=mpg)) %>%
  p_geom_point()

All three of the above give the same plot from what I can see, but I
have not tested it with very many options beyond the above.

A really ambitious person could create a new package with wrappers for
all the ggplot2 functions that can come after the plus sign, then we
could use pipes for everything.  I don't know if there are any strange
circumstances that would make this cause problems (it probably will
slow things down slightly, but probably not enough for people to
notice).

The additional calls to geom_point() and so on will add/change that hidden object. Nothing much happens till the object is implicitly or explicitly given to print() which switches to the print function for objects of that type and creates a graph based on the contents of the object at that time. So, in theory, you could have a pipelined version of ggplot where the first function accepts something like a  data.frame or tibble as the default first argument and at the end returns the object we have been describing. All additional functions would then accept such an object as the (hidden?) first argument and return the modified object. The final function in the pipe would either have the value captured in a variable for later use or print implicitly generating a graph.

Looks like Sergio Oller took your ambitious approach: 
https://github.com/zeehio/ggpipe.  It hasn't been updated since 2017, so 
there may be some new things in ggplot2 that aren't there yet.

If I type my_data_frame_1 and press Enter (or Ctrl+Enter to execute the
command in the Notebook environment I'm using) I certainly *would* expect R
to treat it as a complete statement.

But what I'm talking about is a different case, where I highlight a
multi-line statement in my notebook:

    my_data_frame1
        |> filter(some_conditions_1)

and then press Ctrl+Enter.  Or, I suppose the equivalent would be to run an
R script containing those two lines of code, or to run a multi-line
statement like that from the console (which in RStudio I can do by pressing
Shift+Enter between the lines.)

In those cases, R could either (1) Give an error message [the current
behavior], or (2) understand that the first line is meant to be piped to
the second.  The second option would be significantly more useful, and is
almost certainly what the user intended.

(For what it's worth, there are some languages, such as Javascript, that
consider the first token of the next line when determining if the previous
line was complete.  JavaScript's rules around this are overly complicated,
but a rule like "a pipe following a line break is treated as continuing the
previous line" would be much simpler.  And while it might be objectionable
to treat the operator %>% different from other operators, the addition of
|>, which isn't truly an operator at all, seems like the right time to
consider it.)

I agree with Duncan that the right solution is to wrap the pipe
expression with parentheses. Having the parser treat newlines
differently based on whether the session is interactive, or on what
type of operator happens to follow a newline, feels like a pretty big
can of worms.

I think this (or something similar) would accomplish what you want
while still retaining the nice aesthetics of the pipe expression, with
a minimal amount of syntax "noise":

result <- (
  data
    |> op1()
    |> op2()
)

For interactive sessions where you wanted to execute only parts of the
pipeline at a time, I could see that being accomplished by the editor
-- it could transform the expression so that it could be handled by R,
either by hoisting the pipe operator(s) up a line, or by wrapping the
to-be-executed expression in parentheses for you. If such a style of
coding became popular enough, I'm sure the developers of such editors
would be interested and willing to support this ...

Perhaps more importantly, it would be much easier to accomplish than a
change to the behavior of the R parser, and it would be work that
wouldn't have to be maintained by the R Core team.

Best,
Kevin

The additional calls to geom_point() and so on will add/change that hidden object. Nothing much happens till the object is implicitly or explicitly given to print() which switches to the print function for objects of that type and creates a graph based on the contents of the object at that time. So, in theory, you could have a pipelined version of ggplot where the first function accepts something like a  data.frame or tibble as the default first argument and at the end returns the object we have been describing. All additional functions would then accept such an object as the (hidden?) first argument and return the modified object. The final function in the pipe would either have the value captured in a variable for later use or print implicitly generating a graph.

I don't think I'd like it if parsing changed between passing one line at 
a time and passing a block of lines.  I'd like to be able to highlight a 
few lines and pass those, then type one, then highlight some more and 
pass those:  and have it act as though I just passed the whole combined 
block, or typed everything one line at a time.

I think this would be hard to implement with R's current parser, but 
possible.  I think it could be done by distinguishing between EOL 
markers within a block of text and "end of block" marks.  If it applied 
only to the |> operator it would be *really* ugly.

My strongest objection to it is the one at the top, though.  If I have a 
block of lines sitting in my editor that I just finished executing, with 
the cursor pointing at the next line, I'd like to know that it didn't 
matter whether the lines were passed one at a time, as a block, or some 
combination of those.

   FWIW there is previous discussion of this in a twitter thread from May:

https://twitter.com/bolkerb/status/1258542150620332039

at the end I suggested defining something like .__END <- identity() as a 
pipe-ender.

Regarding special treatment for |>, isn't it getting special treatment
anyway, because it's implemented as a syntax transformation from x |> f(y)
to f(x, y), rather than as an operator?

That said, the point about wanting a block of code submitted line-by-line
to work the same as a block of code submitted all at once is a fair one.
Maybe the better solution would be if there were a way to say "Submit the
selected code as a single expression, ignoring line-breaks".  Then I could
run any number of lines with pipes at the start and no special character at
the end, and have it treated as a single pipeline.  I suppose that'd need
to be a feature offered by the environment (RStudio's RNotebooks in my
case).  I could wrap my pipelines in parentheses (to make the "pipes at
start of line" syntax valid R code), and then could use the hypothetical
"submit selected code ignoring line-breaks" feature when running just the
first part of the pipeline -- i.e., selecting full lines, but starting
after the opening paren so as not to need to insert a closing paren.

   Definitely support the idea that if this kind of trickery is going to 
happen that it be confined to some particular IDE/environment or some 
particular submission protocol. I don't want it to happen in my ESS 
session please ... I'd rather deal with the parentheses.

That's different.  Currently |> is parsed just like any other binary 
operator, it's the code emitted after parsing that is different from 
most other cases.  I think your suggestion would need changes in the 
parsing itself.

It's a few years since I worked with Bison (the parser generator that R 
uses), but I recall that handling inconsistencies was always tricky.

The way to do that is to replace some of the line breaks with 
semicolons, which act as statement separators.  The tricky bit is to 
figure out which ones to replace.  So if your block is

   x +
   y
   z

you'd glue it together as "x + y; z".  RStudio appears to know enough 
about R parsing to do that, and presumably if it was allowed to look at 
the start of the next line could handle things like

   x
   |> f()
   z

and rewrite them as "x |> f(); z".  It would mess up debugging a little 
(z is now on line 1, not line 3), but maybe it could undo the 
transformation if R told it there was a problem at line 1, column 11.


  Then I could run any number of lines with pipes at the

I think I don't understand your workflow enough to comment on this.

Many languages allow a final backslash (?\?) character to allow an
expression to span multiple lines, and I?ve often wished for this in R,
particularly to allow me to put  `else` on a separate line at the
top-level. It would also allow alignment of infix operators like the new
pipe operator `|>` at the start of a line, which I would heartily endorse.

What I mean is, I could add parentheses as suggested to let me put the
pipes at the start of the line, like this:

    (                                  # Line 1
        my_data_frame                  # Line 2
        |> filter(some_condition)      # Line 3
        |> group_by(some_column)       # Line 4
        |> summarize(some_functions)   # Line 5
    )                                  # Line 6

If this gives me an unexpected result, I might want to re-run just up
through line 3 and check the output, to see if something is wrong with the
"filter" (e.g., my condition matched less data than expected).  Ideally, I
could do this without changing the code, by just selecting lines 2 and 3
and pressing Ctrl+Enter (my environment's shortcut for "run selected
code").  But it wouldn't work, because without including the parentheses
these lines would be treated as two separate expressions, the second of
which is invalid since it starts with a pipe.  Alternatively, I could
include line 1 in my selection (along with lines 2 and 3), but it wouldn't
work without having to type a new closing parenthesis after line 3, and
then delete it afterwards.  Or, I could select and comment out lines 4 and
5, and then select and run all 6 lines.  But none of those are as
convenient as just being able to select and run lines 2 and 3 (which is
what I'm used to being able to do in several other languages which support
pipelines).  And though it may seem a minor annoyance, when I'm working a
lot with dplyr code I find myself wanting to do something like this many
times per day.

What *would* work well would be if I could write the code as above, but
then when I want to select and re-run just lines 2 and 3, I would use some
keyboard shortcut that meant "pass this code to the parser as a single
line, with line breaks (and comments) removed".  Then it would be run like
    my_data_frame |> filter(some_condition)
instead of producing an error.  That'd require the environment I'm using --
RStudio -- to support this feature, but wouldn't require any change to how
R is parsed.  From the replies here, I'm coming around to thinking that'd
be the better option.

I'm thrilled to hear it!  Thank you!

P.S. I re-added the r-devel list, since Kevin's reply was sent just to me,
but I thought there might be others interested in knowing about those work
items.  (I hope that's OK, email-etiquette-wise.)

When I am debugging a function with code like
    x <- f1(x)
    x <- f2(x)
    result <- f3(x)
I will often slip a line like '.GlobalEnv$tmp1 <- x' between the first two
lines and '.GlobalEnv$tmp2 <- x' between the last two lines and look at the
intermediate results, 'tmp1' and 'tmp2' in the global environment, later to
see what is going on.

The equivalent expression using pipes is
    x |>
        f1() |>
        f2() \>
        f3() -> result
You can slip lines like 'print() \>' between the pipe parts because
print(x) returns x, but it is more tedious to add assignment lines.  One
could define a function like
   pipe_save <- function(x, name, envir=.GlobalEnv) {
       envir[[name]] <- x
        x
   }
and then puts lines like 'pipe_save("tmp1") |>' into the pipe sequence to
save intermediate results.

A function like
    pipe_eval <- function(x, expr) {
       eval(substitute(expr), list(x=x))
        x
   }
would make it easy to call plot() or summary(), etc., on the piped data
with lines like
   'pipe_eval(print(summary(x)) |>'
inserted into the pipe sequence.

E.g.,

> 1/(1:10) |>
+    pipe_eval(print(summary(x))) |>
+    range() |>
+    pipe_eval(print(x)) |>
+    sum()
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.
 0.1000  0.1295  0.1833  0.2929  0.3125  1.0000
[1] 0.1 1.0
[1] 1.1

You could even add if(isTRUE(getOption("debug"))) before the eval() or
assignment to make these do nothing to make it easy to turn debugging on
and off with options(debug=TRUE/FALSE).

Subject: [Rd] R crashes when using huge data sets with character string
 variables
Message-ID: <CAMTWbJgN-GW9Zp21awbAmXpor9Rqd7H00gZa10K-dFVjrN-ysQ@mail.gmail.com>

When working with a huge data set with character string variables, I
experienced that various commands let R crash. When I run R in a
Linux/bash console, R terminates with the message "Killed". When I use
RStudio, I get the message "R Session Aborted. R encountered a fatal
error. The session was terminated. Start New Session". If an object in
the R workspace needs too much memory, I would expect that R would not
crash but issue an error message "Error: cannot allocate vector of
size ...".  A minimal reproducible example (at least on my computer)
is:

nObs <- 1e9

date <- paste( round( runif( nObs, 1981, 2015 ) ), round( runif( nObs,
1, 12 ) ), round( runif( nObs, 1, 31 ) ), sep = "-" )

Is this a bug or a feature of R?

Some information about my R version, OS, etc:

   On Windows you can use memory.limit.

    Not sure how much that helps.

On OS X I see:

Which is what I would expect.? I don't doubt the error you've seen, just
providing a data point for whoever ends up looking into this further.

If R is receiving a kill signal there is nothing it can do about it.

I am guessing you are running into a memory over-commit issue in your OS.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_overcommitment
https://engineering.pivotal.io/post/virtual_memory_settings_in_linux_-_the_problem_with_overcommit/

If you have to run this close to your physical memory limits you might
try using your shell's facility (ulimit for bash, limit for some
others) to limit process memory/virtual memory use to your available
physical memory. You can also try setting the R_MAX_VSIZE environment
variable mentioned in ?Memory; that only affects the R heap, not
malloc() done elsewhere.

Best,

luke

Similarly, as it is Linux, you could (easily) add virtual memory via a
swapfile (see 'man 8 swapfile' and 'man 8 swapon').  But even then, I expect
this to be slow -- 1e9 is a lot.

I have 32gb and ample swap (which is rarely used, but a safety net). When I
use your code with nObs <- 1e8 it ends up with about 6gb which poses poses no
problem, but already takes 3 1/2 minutes:

> nObs <- 1e8
> system.time(date <- paste( round( runif( nObs, 1981, 2015 ) ), round( runif( nObs, 1, 12 ) ), round( runif( nObs, 1, 31 ) ), sep = "-" ))
   user  system elapsed 
203.723   1.779 205.528

You may want to play with the nObs value to see exactly where it breaks on
your box.

Correct. And in particular, this is most probably the earlyoom [1]
service in action, which, I believe, is installed and enabled by
default in Ubuntu 20.04. It is a simple daemon that monitors memory,
and when some conditions are reached (e.g., the system is about to
start swapping), it looks for offending processes and kills them.

Subject: [Rd] Feature request: adding a log.p= option to stats::p.adjust?
Message-ID: <5f4445af-86dd-15a9-0cd3-97f88d59d9bb@gmail.com>

Dear list,

Is there any interest in adding a log.p= option to p.adjust() so that it 
can accept log-transformed p-values and return log-transformed adjusted 
p-values?

I have some functions that, on occasion, return very low p-values. To 
avoid underflow in such cases, I allow my users to set log.p=TRUE, which 
is passed onto pt(), pchisq(), etc. to return log-transformed p-values. 
However, currently, these log-p-values need to be run through exp() 
before being used in p.adjust(). This re-introduces the possibility of 
underflow errors, sometimes leading to adjusted p-values of zero.

The proposed log.p= mode for p.adjust() would perform all operations in 
the log-scale to avoid this - see 
https://github.com/MarioniLab/scran/blob/f9ace20d74c7fdbde613aaf91311cdfc6dbe0feb/R/utils_markers.R#L184-L190 
for an example with the BH correction. If it were available, we could 
conveniently pass along the log.p=TRUE option to p.adjust() as we do for 
pt() and friends, and everything would "just work".

If this sounds sensible, I would be happy to put a patch together; the 
modifications involved seem simple enough.

Subject: [Rd] Printing Unicode escapes with 6 digits may be problematic
Message-ID: <79fe8d3df2e04ca6b12ae0c1cdb18441@maanmittauslaitos.fi>

A recent R-devel commit introduces a change in the way non-printable Unicode characters are shown as an escape code. Whereas large code points were previously printed using an escape code of 8 hexadecimal digits, with initial zeros, the present code (tested with R-devel r79623 on Ubuntu Linux) only prints 6 hex digits. I think this may be problematic: it is now possible that R prints a character string which is not valid when reused as an input. See the following example.

"\U{16FE4}1"
# [1] "\U016fe41"
"\U016fe41"
# Error: invalid \Uxxxxxxxx value 16fe41 (line 1)

Subject: [Rd] Feature request: better warning message from or documentation
 of terms.formula when LHS variables are after . - on RHS
Message-ID: <CAHHSL8s+GX1tST2JA6tdAf-+ZwdBzcUVJ0fcbwGc_G-ZPQuEPQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Sirs,

Running the following code with R devel (2020-11-30 r79529):

library(survival)
terms.formula(Surv(time, status) ~ . - time - status, data = lung[,
c("time", "status", "ph.ecog")])

gives:

  Warning message:
  In terms.formula(Surv(time, status) ~ . - time - status, data = lung[,  :
    'varlist' has changed (from nvar=2) to new 4 after EncodeVars() --
should no longer happen!

It took me a while to figure out that the cause of the warning is that
time and status appear on both the left hand side and on the right
hand side of the formula after a period and a minus. While this is
likely an error or redundant in almost all cases, it was unclear from
the warning and the .Rd file.

This is somewhat related to
https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17895

but it does not have an error.

Sincerely Yours,
Benjamin

Message-ID: <f03ca92e46c41a40eb918cae1f11f2968ad511db.camel@missouri.edu>

All,

Consider the code below

options(digits=2)
x <- 1:1000
quantile(x, .975)

The value returned is 975 (the 97.5th percentile), but the name has been shortened to "98%" due to the digits option. Is this intended? I would have expected the name to also be "97.5%" here. Alternatively, the returned value might be 980 in order to match the name of "98%".

Best,
Ed

Hi Edgar,

I certainly don't think quantile(x, .975) should return 980, as that is
a completely wrong answer.

I do agree that it seems like the name is a bit offputting. I'm not sure
how deep in the machinery you'd have to go to get digits to no effect on
the names (I don't have time to dig in right this second).

On the other hand, though, if we're going to make the names not respect
digits entirely, what do we do when someone does quantile(x, 1/3)? That'd
be a bad time had by all without digits coming to the rescue, i think.

Best,
~G

The "value" is *not* 975.
It's 975.025.

The results that you're observing, are merely the byproduct of formatting.

Maybe, you should try:

    quantile (x, .975, type=4)

Which perhaps, using default options, produces the result you're expecting?

Dear all

Thanks a lot for your very helpful explanations and suggestions. I
have increased the size of my computer's "swapfile" and this solved my
problem, i.e., R no longer crashes when I work with character string
variables in my large data set (probably until I work with an even
larger data set).

Question: is the part that Ed Merkle is asking about the change in the
expected NAME associated with the output?

He changed a sort of global parameter affecting how many digits he wants any
compliant function to display. So when he asked for a named vector, the
chosen name was based on his request and limited when possible to two
digits.

x <- 1:1000
temp <- quantile(x, .975)

If you examine temp, you will see it is a vector containing (as it happens)
a single numeric item (as it happens a double) with the value of 975. But
the name associated is a character string with a "%" appended as shown
below:

str(temp)
	Named num 975
	- attr(*, "names")= chr "98%"

If you do not want a name attached to the vector, add an option:

quantile(x, .975, names=FALSE)

If you want the name to be longer or different, you can do that after. 

names(temp)
	[1] "98%"

So change it yourself:

temp
	98% 
	975 
 names(temp) <- paste(round(temp, 3), "%", sep="")
temp
	975.025% 
	975

The above is for illustration with tabs inserted to show what is in the
output. You probably do not need a name for your purposes and if you ask for
multiple quantiles you might need to adjust the above. 

Of course if you wanted another non-default "type" of calculation, what Abby
offered may also apply.

Hello,
I'm not sure if the following is intended, or a bug, but "all.vars()"
returns different values, depending on whether "TRUE" or "T" is used inside
"poly()":

m1 <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ poly(Sepal.Width, 2, raw = TRUE) + Petal.Length,
data = iris)
m2 <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ poly(Sepal.Width, 2, raw = T) + Petal.Length, data =
iris)

all.vars(formula(m1))
#> [1] "Sepal.Length" "Sepal.Width"  "Petal.Length"
all.vars(formula(m2))
#> [1] "Sepal.Length" "Sepal.Width"  "T"            "Petal.Length"

I know that "T" is no reserved word, but rather a global variable.
Nonetheless, I just wanted to be clear if there is a bug, or everything
works as intended.

Best
Daniel

It looks as though it is working as documented.  formula(m2) gives

Sepal.Length ~ poly(Sepal.Width, 2, raw = T) + Petal.Length

and all.vars says it returns "a character vector containing all the 
names which occur in an expression or call."  "T" is a name.

There are good reasons why "R CMD check" warns about using T when you 
mean TRUE.

You are right: the question is about the name changing to "98%", when the returned object is the 97.5th percentile.

It is indeed easy to set names=FALSE here. But there can still be a problem when the user sets options(digits=2), then a package calls quantile(x, .975) and expects an object that has a name of "97.5%".

I think the easiest solution is to tell the user not to set options(digits=2), but it also seems like the "98%" name is not the best result. But Gabriel is correct that we would still need to consider how to handle something like quantile(x, 1/3). Maybe it is not a big enough issue to warrant changing anything.

The value returned is 975 (the 97.5th percentile), but the name has been

shortened to "98%" due to the digits option. Is this intended? I would have

expected the name to also be "97.5%" here. Alternatively, the returned value

might be 980 in order to match the name of "98%".


Best,

Ed

Thank you for explaining, Ed. It makes looking at the issue raised much
easier.

 

As I understand it, you are not really asking about some thing fully in your
control. You are asking how any function like quantile() should behave when
a user has altered something global or at least global within a package,
such as this:

 

> quantile(x, c(.95, .975, .99000))

    95%   97.5%     99% 

950.050 975.025 990.010 

> dig.it <- options(digits=2)

> dig.it

$digits

[1] 7

 

I did it that way so I could re-set it!

 

I looked to see if quantile() is written in base R and it seems to be a
generic that I would have to hunt down so I stopped for now.

 

Here is what I get BEFORE changing the option for digits:

 

> x <- 1:1000

> quantile(x, probs=c(.95, .975, .99000))

    95%   97.5%     99% 

950.050 975.025 990.010

 

Note I used the fuller version asking for multiple thresholds so I could see
what happened if I used more zeroes. Note that trailing zeroes are not shown
in the name of the third element of the vector. So I can suggest the program
is not getting the unevaluated text to use but is using the value of the
vector. Now I set the number of digits to 2, globally, and repeat:

 

> quantile(x, probs=c(.95, .975, .99000))

95% 98% 99% 

950 975 990

 

I notice several things as others have pointed out. There seems to be a
truncation in the values shown so nothing is now shown past the decimal
point. But maybe not as adding an argument of 1/3 gives 334 rather than 333.

 

> quantile(x, probs=c(.95, .975, .99000, 1/3))

95% 98% 99% 33% 

950 975 990 334

 

Now the names are apparently rounded as discussed, with the percent symbol
appended.

 

So what would you propose? Within the function there seem to be two parts
dealing with displaying the result and it looks like the original number
loses precision as handing the above to round(., 7) shows no change. So are
you asking it to parse the name different than the value even though there
is a global variable set specifying the digits they want?

 

If it really mattered, I suggest one solution may be to allow one or two
additional arguments to a function like quantile like:

 

quantile(x, ., digits=5, names=c("95%", "97.5%", .) )

 

So if a user really wanted to live in their own world of fewer digits they
could specify what labels they wanted and could ask for "high", "Higher" and
"HIGHEST" or whatever makes them happy. But, as noted, any user wanting that
level of control can change the labels afterward. But you are correct in
some package using quantile() and calling out the results individually by
name will not be able to consistently and reliably use that technique. But
can they use it now? I tried using variations on $.95% such as this and they
fail such as for quantile(x, c(.95, .975, .99000))$`95%` and the same for
using [] notation. These identifiers were not chosen to be used this way.
You can get them positionally:

 

> quantile(x, c(.95, .975, .99000))[1]

95% 

950 

> quantile(x, c(.95, .975, .99000))[2]

98% 

975

 

If you convert the darn out put from a vector to a list, though, it works,
using grave accents:

 

> as.list(quantile(x, c(.95, .975, .99000)))$`98%`

[1] 975

 

So, I doubt many would play games like me to find some way to select by
name. Odds are they might use position or get one at a time. The name is
more for humans to read, I would think.

 

 

Just my two cents. When an instruction impacts multiple places, it can be
ambiguous and changing global variables is, well, global.

 

Which raise another question here is why did the people making choices
choose silly names that are all numeric with maybe a decimal point and
ending in a character like % that has other uses? A cousin of quantile is
fivenum() that returns Tukey's five number summary as useful in making
boxplots:

 

> fivenum(x)

[1]    1  250  500  750 1000

 

This returned a vector with no names. You can only index it by number,
albeit the columns are always in a fixed order and you know what to expect
in each. Another cousin returns a more complex structure 

 

> boxplot.stats(x)

$stats

[1]    1  250  500  750 1000

 

$n

[1] 1000

 

$conf

[1] 476 525

 

$out

integer(0)

 

> boxplot.stats(x)$stats

[1]    1  250  500  750 1000

 

That is a list of items but the first item is a vector with no names that is
the same as for fivenum().

 

Would it make more sense for the column names of the output looked more
like: 

 

> temp <- quantile(x, c(.95, .975, .99000))

> names(temp) <- c("perc95", "perc98", "perc99")

> temp

perc95 perc98 perc99 

   950    975    990

 

So you could do this to a vector:

 

> temp["perc98"]

perc98 

   975

Or do even more to a list:

 

> as.list(temp)$perc98

[1] 975

 

My feeling is some things are not really bugs but more like FEATURES you
normally live with and if it matters, work around it. I had trouble a while
ago with a laavan() case I ran where very rarely the program simply broke.
When in a big loop running hundreds of thousands of times, that messed up as
the program as a whole just stopped. So, I wrapped it and other parts in
variations of try() to bulletproof it and lived with it. Sure, it slowed
down a bit but it ran for hours or days so why fight it to find a subtle bug
in something I could not change. Your question is valid but my guess is few
use it in a way that will get much notice.

The question is indeed about the name changing to "98%", when the returned
object is the 97.5th percentile.

 

It is indeed easy to set names=FALSE here. But there can still be a problem
when the user sets options(digits=2), then a package calls quantile(x, .975)
and expects an object that has a name of "97.5%".

 

I think the easiest solution is to tell the user not to set
options(digits=2), but it also seems like the "98%" name is not the best
result. But Gabriel is correct that we would still need to consider how to
handle something like quantile(x, 1/3). Maybe it is not a big enough issue
to warrant changing anything.

Subject: [Rd] UTF-8 characters in Rd files
Message-ID: <CABtg=Kk=ZA7fUoR5ULm51wtV364UX-_-F-H8vTLfp9JndZe=vA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

I am trying to see if there is a way to expand the set of UTF-8
characters that we can use in Rd files. The main blocker is LaTeX when
building the PDF manual.

It is possible to use the inputenx LaTeX package, instead of inputenc,
which is an improvement, by setting the RD2PDF_INPUTENC env var before
running R CMD Rd2pdf. However, I don't see a way to make this
automatic for a package, so we cannot use it for CRAN packages, as far
as I can tell.

Am I missing something? Would it make sense to have a way to specify
RD2PDF_INPUTENC (and possibly other similar env vars) for packages?

As for the possible implementation, one way would be to have a file
called `environ` or something similar in /man, that could define env
vars, and Rd2pdf would just read it in with readRenviron().

Thanks,
Gabor

and now we read more replies on this topic without anyone looking at
the pure R source code which is pretty simple and easy.
Instead, people do experiments and take time to muse about their findings..

Honestly, I'm disappointed: I've always thought that if you
*write* on R-devel, you should be able to figure out a few
things yourself before that..

It's not rocket science to see/know that you need to quickly look at
the quantile.default() method function and then to note 
that it's  format_perc(.) which is used to create the names.

Almost surely, I've been a bit envolved in creating parts of
this and probably am responsible for the current default
behavior.

so this was before this was modularized into the format_perc()
utility and quite a while before R 1.0.0 ....

Now, 22.8 years later, I do think that indeed it was not
necessarily the best idea to make the names() construction depend  on the
'digits' option entirely and just protect it by using at least 2 digits.

What I think is better is to

1) provide an optional argument   'digits = 7'
   back compatible w/ default getOption("digits")

2) when used, check that it is at least '1'

But then some scripts / examples of some people *will* change
..., e.g., because they preferred to have a global setting of digits=5

so I'm guessing it may make more people unhappy than other
people happy if we change this now, after close to 23 years  .. ??

Subject: [Rd] power.prop.test() documentation question
Message-ID: <406AE484-E1B5-49E0-9FB1-C022C0415947@me.com>

Hi All,

Based upon a discussion on power/sample size calculations on another, non-R related, list, some light bulbs went on regarding the assumptions of what type of statistical test is going to be used with various power/sample size calculators/functions for proportions. In some cases, this is clearly stated, in others, it is not.

In the case of power.prop.test() and comparing outputs against other calculators, there appears to be an implied presumption that an un-corrected chi-square test will be used, as opposed to a corrected chi-square or Fisher Exact Test (FET), in the 2x2 case. Sample sizes for the un-corrected chi-square will generally be smaller than either the corrected chi-square or the FET, given similar inputs, where the latter two, not surprisingly given their common conservative bias, will yield similar sample size results. 

This is not explicitly documented in ?power.prop.test, though it is in some other applications, as noted above. 

As a particular example from the other discussions, using p1 = 0.142, p2 = 0.266, with power = 0.8 and sig.level = 0.05, power.prop.test() yields a sample size of ~165 per group. Other calculators that presume either a corrected chi-square or the FET, yield ~180 per group. 

I raise this issue, as should one use the function to calculate a prospective sample size for a study, and then actually use a corrected chi-square to analyze the data, per routine use and/or a formal analysis plan, the power of that test will be lower than that which was presumed for the a priori calculation. It may not make a big difference in some proportion of the cases relative to p <= alpha, but given the idiosyncrasies of the observed data at the end of the study, along with the effective loss of some power, it may very well be relevant to the results and their strict interpretation. It may also impact, to some extent, the a priori planning for the study, relative to the needed target sample size, budgeting and other considerations for a study sponsor.

Is there any logic in adding some notes to ?power.prop.test, to indicate the implied presumption of the use of an un-corrected chi-square test? 

Thanks for any comments, including telling me that I need more caffeine and to increase my oxygen uptake...

Regards,

Marc Schwartz

That's a bit unfair.
Some of us have written packages, containing functions for computing
quantile names:

     probhat::ntile.names (,100)

I'm not sure I've got this right.
Are you suggesting that by default, names should have 7 digits?


> so I'm guessing it may make more people unhappy than other

I would probably be in the less enthusiastic group.
I take the view that quantile naming is mainly a convenience, for
summary-style output.

And on that basis, I would say the current behaviour is about right.
Anyone looking for high precision, should probably compute their own
quantile names.


Also, expanding on an earlier point.
The value was 975.025, so a label of "97.5%" could still cause problems.
Increasing the precision doesn't necessarily fix this sort of problem.
But rather, increases the complexity of the output, beyond what
"97.5%" of users would ever want...

Sorry, I need to change my last post.

I looked at this a bit more, and realized that increasing the (max)
number of (name) digits is only relevant in some cases.
For people computing quartiles and deciles, this shouldn't make any difference.
Therefore, should still be convenient for the purposes of summary-style output.

The hunspell package uses the code below to replace curly quotes (aka

spelling:

    chartr("\u2019", "'", input)

As of last week this stopped working on CRAN in the Linux server that

longer parses the escaped unique string, which gets turned into
"<U+2019>".

Is this expected?

You need to explain why this is desirable.

The other limiting factor is availability of the glyphs in fonts 
(especially for PDF and its viewers, and the man pages are rendered in 
PDF on CRAN).  Ten years ago that was a serious limitation and I am 
unaware of much change.

Also, inputenx.sty is not part of basic TeX environments such example 
BasicTeX on macOS, so it cannot be made the default.

Subject: [Rd] motivation behind the fact that printing R vectors take equal
 (maximum one) amount of lines for each element
Message-ID: <CAL-tqL=_UUKTB6xfQY0Frp=-1OYK1HNf0vbNhUOXPUCY2-nDLQ@mail.gmail.com>

What is the motivation behind the fact that printing R vectors take equal
(maximum one) amount of lines for each element?
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65355999/what-is-motivation-behind-the-fact-that-printing-r-vectors-take-equal-maximum-o>

The vector x has a large string at index 2, while a small string at index
1. When we do a print, even the entry at index 1 takes two lines. In other
words, the element at index 2 is printed after leaving an empty line. When
we run a command using system using intern arg, there may be outputs of
varying length, and then output is clumsy, as maximum no of lines are used
for each element of the vector

x = c("11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111")
x = c("2", x)
x
#Output
[1] "2"

[2] "11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111"

Why could printing with some delimiters, like a comma or space etc, not
suffice ? Similar args may apply for a vector containing some large
numbers, and some small numbers, but we will take more space to print

(They were getting things wrong in a platform-dependent way, and it

You need to distinguish the string and what gets printed.  I see (for 
the CRAN log from a 2-day-old R)

  Error in chartr("<U+2019>", "'", as.character(add_words)) :

which is what I would expect to be printed in that locale:

Changes are expected, as this is an area being worked on (to try to 
remove some system-dependent behaviour).  However, I cannot reproduce 
this easily:

> chartr("\u2019", "'", "abc\u2019")
[1] "abc'"

As I say, work in progress.

Subject: [Rd] From .Fortran to .Call?
Message-ID: <4972E445-44EB-4E2E-B9CB-4A274972BE71@illinois.edu>

There are comments in various places, including R-extensions ?5.4 suggesting that .Fortran is (nearly)
deprecated and hinting that use of .Call is more efficient and now preferred for packages.  I understand
and greatly appreciate its use with dyn.load() and R CMD SHLIB for development workflow.
In an effort to modernize my quantreg package I wanted to solicit some advice 
about whether it was worthwhile to move away from .Fortran, and if so how this
might be most expeditiously carried out.

As things currently stand my src directory has, in addition to couple dozen .f 
files, a file called quantreg_init.c that contains

#include <R_ext/RS.h>
#include <stdlib.h> // for NULL
#include <R_ext/Rdynload.h>

/* .Fortran calls */
extern void F77_NAME(brutpow)(void *, void *, void *, void *, void *, void *, void *, void *, void *, void *, void *, void *, void *, void *);
extern void F77_NAME(combin)(void *, void *, void *, void *, void *, void *, void *);
extern void F77_NAME(crqf)(void *, void *, void *, void *, void *, void *, void *, void *, void *, void *, void *, void *, void *, void *, void *, void *, void *, void *, void *, void *, void *, void *, void *, void *, void *, void *);

?

static const R_FortranMethodDef FortranEntries[] = {
    {"brutpow",   (DL_FUNC) &F77_NAME(brutpow),   14},
    {"combin",    (DL_FUNC) &F77_NAME(combin),     7},
    {"crqf",      (DL_FUNC) &F77_NAME(crqf),      26},

...

void R_init_quantreg(DllInfo *dll)
{
    R_registerRoutines(dll, CEntries, NULL, FortranEntries, NULL);
    R_useDynamicSymbols(dll, FALSE);
}
This was originally setup by an experienced R person in about 2006, but has
always been rather opaque to me; I just follow the template to add fortran
functions.  My questions are:  what would I need to do beyond replacing
.Fortran calls by .Call in my R code?  And would it help? Obviously, what
I?m dreading is being told that all those ?void?s would have to be specified
more explicitly even though they are already specified in the fortran.  My willingness to
embarrass myself by writing this message was triggered by comparing
timings of a prototype function in R and its fortranization in which the
prototype was actually faster.  Thanks in advance for any suggestions.

To make C prototypes for routines defined in a *.f file you can use
gfortran's -fc-prototypes-external flag.  You still have to convert 'name_'
to 'F77_NAME(name).

My understanding of ?5.4 and 5.5 is that explicit routine registration
is what's important for efficiency, and your package already does that
(i.e. calls R_registerRoutines()). The only two things left to add
would be types (REALSXP/INTSXP/...) and styles (R_ARG_IN,
R_ARG_OUT/...) of the arguments of each subroutine.

Switching to .Call makes sense if you want to change the interface of
your native subroutines to accept arbitrary heavily structured SEXPs
(and switching to .External could be useful if you wanted to play with
evaluation of the arguments).

P.S. I think that this question is better asked in the
r-package-devel at r-project.org mailing list instead of R-devel.

Subject: [Rd] Silent failure with NA results in fligner.test()
Message-ID: <F0CEF292-9CDF-4484-B517-819B8527BDC4@gmail.com>

Hello,

In certain cases fligner.test() returns NaN statistic and NA p-value.
The issue happens when, after centering with the median, all absolute values become constant, which ten leads to identical ranks.

Below are a few examples:

# 2 groups, 2 values each
# issue is caused by residual values after centering (-0.5, 0.5, -0.5, 0.5)
# then, after taking the absolute value, all the ranks become identical.
> fligner.test(c(2,3,4,5), gl(2,2))

        Fligner-Killeen test of homogeneity of variances

data:  c(2, 3, 4, 5) and gl(2, 2)
Fligner-Killeen:med chi-squared = NaN, df = 1, p-value = NA


# similar situation with more observations and 3 groups
> fligner.test(c(2,3,2,3,4,4,5,5,8,9,9,8), gl(3,4))

        Fligner-Killeen test of homogeneity of variances

data:  c(2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 8, 9, 9, 8) and gl(3, 4)
Fligner-Killeen:med chi-squared = NaN, df = 2, p-value = NA


Two simple patches are proposed below. One returns an error, and another returns a p-value of 1.
Not sure which one is more appropriate, so submitting both.

Warm regards,
Karolis Koncevi?ius

Hi,

For my use, outside of the R environment, I am trying access the
BLAS, LAPACK and LINPACK linear algebra functions included in R

I am following the instructions here . . .

6.17 Using these functions in your own C code
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Standalone-Mathlib
AND
9.1 Unix-alike
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-admin.html#Unix_002dalike-standalone

to get . . .

6.7 Numerical analysis subroutines
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Numerical-analysis-subroutines

However, when I run configure, I (eventually) get this error, and configure stops . . .

```
ComputerUser at COMPUTER MINGW64 /c/APPLICATIONS/r-source-R-4-0-branch
$ ./configure --with-x=no

checking for BSD networking... configure: error: BSD networking functions are required
```

What do I need to do next?

Thanks,
Andre Mikulec

MinGW64 seems to be not sufficiently Unix-alike for ./configure to
conclude that it has sockets API (WinSock header names and some type
definitions are different from its expectations). You seem to be on
Windows. What happens if you follow the Windows workflow from the next
section?

https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-admin.html#Windows-standalone

Apologies if I'm missing some context, but it seems to me that the
Windows workflow is what's needed here.

Ivan and all,

Thanks,

I compiled R from source on windows.

Next, I followed:

That works.

All,

Actually, I mis-read the instructions, I now have access to many R functions, but not  BLAS, LAPACK and LINPACK (directly).

That is something else I am still working on.

Subject: [Rd] setting .libPaths() with parallel::clusterCall
Message-ID: <CAOKDuOhSBqQs1N87=A81XR+nm=fx438vPnjo4kJN538K9OBj7w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

It is not possible to set library paths on worker nodes with
parallel::clusterCall (or snow::clusterCall) and I wonder if this is
intended behavior.

Example.

library(parallel)
libdir <- "./tmplib"
if (!dir.exists(libdir)) dir.create("./tmplib")

cl <- makeCluster(2)
clusterCall(cl, .libPaths, c(libdir, .libPaths()) )

The output is as expected with the extra libdir returned for each worker
node. However, running

clusterEvalQ(cl, .libPaths())

Shows that the library paths have not been set.

If this is indeed a bug, I'm happy to file it at bugzilla. Tested on R
4.0.3 and r-devel.

Best,
Mark
ps: a workaround is documented here:

Use this:

     clusterCall(cl, ".libPaths", c(libdir, .libPaths()) )

This will find the function .libPaths on the workers.

Your clusterCall sends across a serialized copy of your process'
.libPaths and calls that. Usually that is equivalent to calling the
function found by the name you used on the workers, but not when the
function has an enclosing environment that the function modifies by
assignment.

Alternate implementations of .libPaths that are more
serialization-friendly are possible in principle but probably not
practical given limitations of the base package.

The distinction between providing a function value or a character
string as the function argument to clusterCall and others could
probably use a paragraph in the help file; happy to consider a patch
if anyone wants to take a crack at it.

Best,

luke

Subject: [Rd] brief update on the pipe operator in R-devel
Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.2.21.2012221624270.3391@luke-Latitude-7480>

It turns out that allowing a bare function expression on the
right-hand side (RHS) of a pipe creates opportunities for confusion
and mistakes that are too risky. So we will be dropping support for
this from the pipe operator.

The case of a RHS call that wants to receive the LHS result in an
argument other than the first can be handled with just implicit first
argument passing along the lines of

     mtcars |> subset(cyl == 4) |> (\(d) lm(mpg ~ disp, data = d))()

It was hoped that allowing a bare function expression would make this
more convenient, but it has issues as outlined below. We are exploring
some alternatives, and will hopefully settle on one soon after the
holidays.

The basic problem, pointed out in a comment on Twitter, is that in
expressions of the form

     1 |> \(x) x + 1 -> y
     1 |> \(x) x + 1 |> \(y) x + y

everything after the \(x) is parsed as part of the body of the
function.  So these are parsed along the lines of

     1 |> \(x) { x + 1 -> y }
     1 |> \(x) { x + 1 |> \(y) x + y }

In the first case the result is assigned to a (useless) local
variable.  Someone writing this is more likely to have intended to
assign the result to a global variable, as this would:

     (1 |> \(x) x + 1) -> y

In the second case the 'x' in 'x + y' refers to the local variable 'x'
in the first RHS function. Someone writing this is more likely to have
meant

     (1 |> \(x) x + 1) |> \(y) x + y

with 'x' in 'x + y' now referring to a global variable:

     > x <- 2
     > 1 |> \(x) x + 1 |> \(y) x + y
     [1] 3
     > (1 |> \(x) x + 1) |> \(y) x + y
     [1] 4

These issues arise with any approach in R that allows a bare function
expression on the RHS of a pipe operation. It also arises in other
languages with pipe operators. For example, here is the last example
in Julia:

     julia> x = 2
     2
     julia> 1 |> x -> x + 1 |> y -> x + y
     3
     julia> ( 1 |> x -> x + 1 ) |> y -> x + y
     4

Even though proper use of parentheses can work around these issues,
the likelihood of making mistakes that are hard to track down is too
high. So we will disallow the use of bare function expressions on the
right hand side of a pipe.

Best,

luke

To deal with such Fortran issues in several packages I deal with, I 
wrote the SUtools package (https://github.com/bnaras/SUtools) that you 
can try.? The current version generates the registration assuming 
implicit Fortran naming conventions though. (I've been meaning to 
upgrade it to use the gfortran -fc-prototypes-external flag which should 
be easy; I might just finish that during these holidays.)

There's a vignette as well:

Hello, Ivan.

I used .Call instead of .Fortran in the Delaporte package [1]. What
helped me out a lot was Drew Schmidt's Romp examples and descriptions
[2]. If you are more comfortable with the older Fortran interface,
Tomasz Kalinowski has a package which uses Fortran 2018 more
efficiently [3]. I haven't tried this last in practice, however.

Hope that helps,

Avi

Dear Luke,

Thank you, this makes perfect sense.

I find it quite hard to express this issue in a way that is both compact
and understandable.
In any case, below you find a proposal for an update of the documentation.

Thank you again for all your work,
Mark

Thanks to all and best wishes for a better 2021.

Unfortunately I remain somewhat confused:

	o  Bill reveals an elegant way to get from my rudimentary  registration setup to
	one that would explicitly type the C interface functions,

	o Ivan seems to suggest that there would be no performance gain from doing this.

	o  Naras?s pcLasso package does use the explicit C typing, but then uses .Fortran
	not .Call.

	o  Avi uses .Call and cites the Romp package https://github.com/wrathematics/Romp
	where it is asserted that "there is a (nearly) deprecated interface .Fortran() which you 
	should not use due to its large performance overhead.?

As the proverbial naive R (ab)user I?m left wondering:  

	o  if I updated my quantreg_init.c file in accordance with Bill?s suggestion could I
	then simply change my .Fortran calls to .Call?

	o  and if so, do I need to include ALL the fortran subroutines in my src directory
	or only the ones called from R?

	o  and in either case could I really expect to see a significant performance gain?

Finally, perhaps I should stipulate that my fortran is strictly f77, so no modern features
are in play, indeed most of the code is originally written in ratfor, Brian Kernighan?s
dialect from ancient times at Bell Labs.

Again,  thanks to all for any advice,
Roger

I think it should be pretty easy to fix up SUtools to use the .Call 
instead of .Fortran following along the lines of

https://github.com/wrathematics/Romp

I too deal with a lot of f77 and so I will most likely finish it before 
the new year, if not earlier. (Would welcome testers besides myself.)

Incidentally, any idea of what the performance hit is, quantitatively? I 
confess I never paid attention to it myself as most Fortran code I use 
seems pretty fast, i.e. glmnet.

Hi.

I haven't tested the speed of the old .Fortran interface, but in this
post [1] I describe how to build a simple interface (there are two
small packages on github that correspond to the code) and in this one
[2] I compare the speed of the different languages, but all using
.Call.

Hope that helps,

Avi

This scares me somewhat: Where in ?5.4 do you find that suggestion? My 
package eha is built upon a stand-alone Fortran 77 program from the 
early eighties (emanating from an appendix in [1]) and has served me 
well over the years, I see no reason at all to switch to .Call for that 
old stuff. But of course, if .Fortran will be deprecated ... Can someone 
confirm if, and if so when, that will happen?

Regarding speed, as I understand it, it is a question of making many 
(short) calls to .Fortran for solving one problem. If you make only one 
or just a few calls to .Fortran (the case in eha), no problem.

well, glmnet's src/*.f  code seems closer to assembly than to
even old fortran 77 style ..
which would not change when calling it via .Call() ...
;-)

The performance "hit" of using .Fortran is probably almost only
from the fact .C() and .Fortran() now compulsorily *copy* their
arguments, whereas with .Call() you are enabled to shoot
yourself in both feet .. ;-)

Subject: [Rd] Silent failure with NA results in fligner.test()
Message-ID: <CACT_sGYaQyCC5PNEYF5UYApKgjWqAa3K6HqsEAawankh2YJ5fQ@mail.gmail.com>

To me it seems like returning chi-sq = 0 and p-value = 1 would make sense.
It would also be consistent with other scenarios of equal variance in all
groups. One example:

fligner.test(1:8, gl(2,4))
#        Fligner-Killeen test of homogeneity of variances
#
# data:  1:8 and gl(2, 4)
# Fligner-Killeen:med chi-squared = 0, df = 1, p-value = 1

But I am aware that other tests implemented in stats:: sometimes throw
errors in similar situations.

Maybe someone more familiar with the behaviour and philosophy behind
stats:: preferences can add more weight here?

Warm regards,
Karolis K.

Also, just came to know about dotcall64::.C64() (on CRAN) which allows 
for Fortran to be called using .Call().

Subject: [Rd] WRE still hints at the "styles" field in R_FortranMethodDef
Message-ID: <20201224100015.0f64e40f@trisector>

The field has been removed in R 3.4.0 after being deprecated in R
3.3.3. Indeed, the paragraph describing it has been commented out
(lines 10144-10151 in R-exts.texi), but another paragraph above (lines
10101-10110) still mentions the field as if it exists. I would like to
suggest some rewording along the lines of the attached patch in order
to avoid confusing readers like me.

Not sure....
If all of the variances are zero,  they are homogenous in that sense,
and I would give a  p-value of 1  ..
if only *some* of the variances are zero... it's less easy.

I still would try to *not* give an error in such cases  and even
prefer  NA  statistic and p-value..  because yes, these are "not
available" for such data.
But it is not strictly an error to try such a test on data of the
correct format...   Consequently, personally I would even try to not
give the current error ... but rather return NA values here:

Yes, dotcall64 looks interesting.  There is a paper about it here:

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352711018300785?via%3Dihub

and the R spam package contains many examples of its use for fortran source.

I?ve recoded a version of one of my quantile regression fitting functions to use .C64 from dotCall64 rather than .Fortran.
For a moderately large problem with n = 500,000 and p = 5, and solving for  1:49/50 quantiles the new version shows
a 3% speedup, although for smaller problems it is actually slower that the .Fortran version.  So, I?m (provisionally) 
unimpressed by the claims that .Fortran has a big ?overhead? performance penalty.  Compared to the(more than) an order of
magnitude (base 10) improvement that moving from R to fortran produces,  3% isn?t really worth the (admittedly) minimal
additional coding effort.

Indeed, using profmem there is a significant advantage in memory:

   There is a recurring issue with installing from source into paths 
that contain single quotes/apostrophes. "Why would anyone do that??" is 
certainly a legitimate response to such a problem, but I would also say 
this constitutes a legitimate bug.  Would replacing both single-quotes 
below with \\' solve the problem?
    I'm happy to post this (with a patch if my fix seems appropriate) on 
r-bugzilla.

Here, I'm mostly among the  "Why would anyone do that??" people,
but I agree that it's worth some effort to try fixing this.

To your question above: Why don't you create a repr.ex. (we'd 
want anyway for R-bugzilla) and *see* if your proposition solves
it - or did I misinterpret the Q?

Subject: [Rd] .Fortran to .Call
Message-ID: <28fddd$f61ddh@ironport10.mayo.edu>

Roger,
 ?Over the years I have converted many of the .C calls in the survival package to .Call.? 
As others have said, the big advantage is memory footprint.? I did it because there are a 
few users who call survfit or coxph with really large data sets, and not copying the data 
can be the difference between success and failure (run out of memory).? Like you, my 
experience has been that if there is enough memory, then the time required for .C or 
.Fortran to make the data copy is minimal.?? Don't make the change in order to gain 
compute speed.

The downside to .Call is that R then makes the (dangerous) assumption that you know what 
you are doing.? That is, vectors/matrices that are passed in to the function will NOT have 
new data values written into them, unless you have taken the necessary steps.?? Breaking 
the promise can lead to program failures that are very hard to track down.

Subject: [Rd] Suppress conflict messages when mask.ok
Message-ID: <CAAwbYcy=-+Gp=MjaVq19pVUndtKyfkcFEU9scLV9WqhPZtS0DQ@mail.gmail.com>

I was very happy to see the new mask.ok option. It works very well when
conflicts.policy is "strict":

---
options(conflicts.policy="strict")
library(igraph, exclude="decompose", mask.ok=c("spectrum","union"))
#> [No messages]
---

However, if no conflicts.policy has been set, the masked objects are loudly
reported, even if they are specified with mask.ok:

---
library(igraph, exclude="decompose", mask.ok=c("spectrum","union"))
#>
#> Attaching package: 'igraph'
#> The following object is masked from 'package:stats':
#>
#>     spectrum
#> The following object is masked from 'package:base':
#>

It seems that if I specify mask.ok, that particular masking is expected and
should NOT be reported, regardless of what the conflicts.policy is. It
would be very useful for many users who are not ready to switch over to a
strict conflicts.policy, to nevertheless be able to suppress messages about
expected conflicts using mask.ok and thus only get messages when unexpected
masking occurs.

Best,
Magnus

Hello,

R 4.0.3 on Ubuntu 20.10, session info at end.

Isn't the default value of argument drop missing in

?`[.data.frame`

Usage:

      ## S3 method for class 'data.frame'
      x[i, j, drop = ]


I had the impression that it was TRUE (it is when running the function, 
I'm talking about the docs).

No, you can see it if you print `[.data.frame`:

 > `[.data.frame`
function (x, i, j, drop = if (missing(i)) TRUE else length(cols) ==
     1)

So if you ask for specific rows and your dataframe has more than one 
column, it defaults to FALSE.

I think the Rd checks allow you to leave out defaults, but don't allow 
you to state them incorrectly, so that's probably why it is left as 
blank in the Usage section, and explained in the Arguments section.

Yes, indeed, Duncan,  it is as you think (above).

It is "official" in the sense that we've used this for a long
time in order to keep the 'Usage' section cleaner, when some
defaults are sophisticated, and a help page reader should rather
read the corresponding argument description.

Hello,

Thank you both, Duncan and Martin, for the quick and clear answer.
I hadn't considered printing `[.data.frame`, which is in fact very 
useful, but I had read the Arguments section. What I didn't realize was 
that it was the answer to the question. Sorry for the noise.

Erin,  I think rumors of the deprecation of .Fortran are greatly exaggerated, but I?d welcome some confirmation of this from
someone in R core.  There is quite a lot of .Fortran usage  in packages, and perhaps even in base R...

As for speed, I suspect much of the speedup when converting from .Fortran
to .Call will be due to checking the validity of the arguments (lengths,
types, ranges, etc.) in C code instead of in R code.  There can also be
less copying of the arguments and the returned objects will tend to be
smaller.

       As the proverbial naive R (ab)user I?m left wondering:

        o  if I updated my quantreg_init.c file in accordance with Bill?s
suggestion could I
        then simply change my .Fortran calls to .Call?

No.  .Call(C_func, arg1, arg2) expects C_func's arguments to all be SEXP*
(pointers to R objects), never the double* or the like that .Fortran
expects.

Subject: [Rd] In function isum in summary.c, k should be R_xlen_t
References: <1102595920.2155560.1608633014464.ref@mail.yahoo.com>
Message-ID: <1102595920.2155560.1608633014464-9062@mail.yahoo.com>


In summary.c, in function 'isum', the loop is 'ITERATE_BY_REGION' that contains 'for' loop
for (int k = 0; k < nbatch; k++)
It is since SVN revision 73445, in released R since version 3.5.0.
Previously, the loop is
for (R_xlen_t i = 0; i < n; i++)

Inside 'ITERATE_BY_REGION', the type of the index, 'k', should still be 'R_xlen_t' as previously. If 'sx' is a regular vector (not ALTREP), data pointer is taken and 'nbatch' is the length of the vector, like without 'ITERATE_BY_REGION'. With 64-bit R, it is possible that the vector is a long vector. In that case, correct iteration should reach index outside the range of 'int'.

However, I haven't found an example in 64-bit R of wrong behavior of

Don't know this piece well but I am guessing that you haven't found an
example because the iterator is going up to the length of a vector
anymore but only to the number of batches, which is unlikely to be
more than 2^31.

If 'sx' is a regular vector (not ALTREP), data pointer is taken and 'nbatch' is the length of the vector, like without 'ITERATE_BY_REGION'. With 64-bit R, it is possible that the vector is a long vector. In that case, correct iteration should reach index outside the range of 'int'.
