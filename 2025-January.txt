Hello all,

I am running R version 4.4.2 (2024-10-31 ucrt) on Windows 10 x64, and
noticed something that might be a minor bug (or at least inconsistent code)
in the stats/arima.R package.
I have found:
1. A missing stop() call at line 69:
    if (length(order) == 3) seasonal <- list(order = seasonal) else
("\'seasonal\' is of the wrong length")
it should be rather:
    if (length(order) == 3) seasonal <- list(order = seasonal) else
stop("\'seasonal\' is of the wrong length")

2. An unused 'mod' variable assignment at line 190:

mod <- makeARIMA(trarma[[1]], trarma[[2]], Delta, kappa, SSinit)

I am trying to confirm whether this is intended behavior or possibly an
overlooked detail. Could someone please clarify if the current logic is
correct?

Thank you.

Best regards,
Norbert Kuder

I think you're right about this one.

In the R-devel source I see mod being used in the next statement:

         mod <- makeARIMA(trarma[[1L]], trarma[[2L]], Delta, kappa, SSinit)
         val <- if(ncxreg > 0L)
             arimaSS(x - xreg %*% coef[narma + (1L:ncxreg)], mod)
         else arimaSS(x, mod)

It appears in both alternatives of the if statement.

This one is strange though:  the code in the github mirror 
(https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/4a1ed749271c52e60a85e794e6f34b0831efb1ae/src/library/stats/R/arima.R#L256-L258) 
is different:

         mod <- makeARIMA(trarma[[1L]], trarma[[2L]], Delta, kappa, SSinit)
         if(ncxreg > 0) x <- x - xreg %*% coef[narma + (1L:ncxreg)]
         arimaSS(x, mod)

yet the log shows no recent changes.  I'm not sure what's going on.

Mystery solved:  code like this appears several times in that file.  In 
the occurrence here:

https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/4a1ed749271c52e60a85e794e6f34b0831efb1ae/src/library/stats/R/arima.R#L293

it does appear that the mod value isn't being used.

Thank you, Norbert and Duncan.
A little bit (unfinished)  aRcheology showed that both parts
have been in the arima code since Dec 11 2003 (when the code, i.e., the
whole package 'ts') was moved / merged into package 'stats'.

I'll fix and quickly test the change, and then commit it.

Congratulations indeed to Norbert Kuder for finding such (small)
blemishes of such an age!

... and  Happy New yeaR!   to all readers.
Martin

well, actually, the mishap is larger:

Reading the help page for arima,  'seasonal' is documented as

 seasonal: A specification of the seasonal part of the ARIMA model, plus
           the period (which defaults to ?frequency(x)?).  This may be a
           list with components ?order? and ?period?, or just a numeric
           vector of length 3 which specifies the seasonal ?order?.  In
           the latter case the default period is used.

Note the
    or just a numeric vector of length 3 ... the seasonal 'order'
part.
If you look at the larger context of the

   else ("'seasonal...

part, it becomes clear that -- in order to fulfill the above
documented behavior, it's not length(order),
but length(seasonal) which should be 3   which leads to the
following change :

@@ -124,10 +124,11 @@
             if(!is.numeric(seasonal$order) || length(seasonal$order) != 3L
                || any(seasonal$order < 0L))
                 stop("'seasonal$order' must be a non-negative numeric vector of length 3")
-        } else if(is.numeric(order)) {
-            if(length(order) == 3L) seasonal <- list(order=seasonal)
-            else ("'seasonal' is of the wrong length")
-        } else stop("'seasonal' must be a list with component 'order'")
+        } else if(is.numeric(seasonal)) { # meant to be  seasonal$order
+            if(length(seasonal) != 3L || any(seasonal < 0))
+                stop("if not a list, 'seasonal' must be a non-negative numeric vector of length 3")
+            seasonal <- list(order=seasonal)
+        } else stop("'seasonal' must be a list with component 'order' or length-3 vector")
 

... I still plan to commit this, but it may well be that this
change will wake up arima() use that was buggy and never detected
till now.
