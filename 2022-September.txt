Hi,

Did you manage to get to a blog post at some point?

I just saw that there was an live-streaming lecture on August 4th - 
https://sms.wgtn.ac.nz/cgi-bin/seminars?rm=details&id=987

Was this perhaps recorded anywhere?

right, that could be improved. Do you have an example which exhibits the

Both R_check_class_etc and R_check_class_and_super are unfortunately 
exported, the former is used a lot in packages (even though they are not 
mentioned in Writing R Extensions, so actually shouldn't be used in 
packages). Anyway, it would be easier if we could preserve their 
interface and behavior.

Maybe we could support rho==NULL in R_check_class_and_super, the 
environment would be looked up in that case when needed. 
R_check_class_etc would simply only call R_check_class_and_super with 
that argument. I see that R_check_class_and_super uses asChar() on the 
class attribute, while R_check_class_etc does not currently for looking 
for the environment, but I assume doing that in both cases should not 
matter (and it would have to be tested).

So this would be a trivial change, but if you wanted to create a minimal 
patch, I will be happy to have a look.

Best
Tomas

I benchmarked .Call("R_etc", x) for x <- new("dgTMatrix"), after compiling
and loading the following:

```
#include <Rinternals.h>

SEXP R_etc(SEXP x) {
     static const char *valid[] = {"dgCMatrix", "dgRMatrix", "dgTMatrix", ""};
     return ScalarInteger(R_check_class_etc(x, valid));
}
```

R-devel used ~2 microseconds while my patched version of R used ~0.2
microseconds.  So, not a bottleneck by any means.  On the other hand,
'Matrix' and probably other packages do call R_check_class_etc() quite
often, hence my report.

I've implemented essentially what you've described; see attached.

Subject: [Rd] Passing a call as label to text() works differently when the
 call involves paste() vs paste0()
Message-ID: <d6a1ccfe0082445b8f74a32f1e511e48@UM-MAIL3214.unimaas.nl>

Hi all,

Maybe a bit of an esoteric observation, but the second one doesn't work properly:

x <- 2
plot(NA, xlim=c(0,1), ylim=c(0,1))
text(0.5, 0.55, bquote(paste("x =", .(x))))
text(0.5, 0.45, bquote(paste0("x = ", .(x))))

Note that this has nothing to do in particular with bquote(). This is the same issue:

plot(NA, xlim=c(0,1), ylim=c(0,1))
text(0.5, 0.55, as.call(list(quote(paste), "x =", 2)))
text(0.5, 0.45, as.call(list(quote(paste0), "x = ", 2)))

I had a look at C_text in plot.c, but couldn't figure out why the second one is treated differently.

Best,
Wolfgang

You're using plotmath code, which is documented in ?plotmath.

It doesn't execute paste(), it just uses that name for a similar 
operation.  There's no operation named paste0(), so that doesn't work.

The paste() operation doesn't add space, so it's more like paste0() in 
any case.

I see, ideally one would have a real scenario with a real performance 
issue leading to this. With a micro-benchmark, one could come up with 
pretty much arbitrary speedup, so it is harder to judge whether an 
optimization is actually worth the effort, the risk of introducing bugs 
and sometimes the added complexity.

Thanks, I've restored the original behavior with pkg == R_NilValue (note 
rho was R_GlobalEnv), I've used C NULL to mark the special mode when 
"rho" should be found, and I made some small tweaks. I will add after 
more testing, if the results are ok.

Yes.  I _was_ at first thinking about a less artificial example
(and in retrospect I probably should have led with that):

## install.packages("Matrix", repos = "http://R-Forge.R-project.org")
library(Matrix)
n <- 10L
x <- new("dgeMatrix", Dim = c(n, n), x = as.double(seq_len(n^2)))
microbenchmark::microbenchmark(t(x))

where the 't' method calls the C-level unpackedMatrix_transpose(),
which in turn calls R_check_class_etc().

Makes sense - thanks for catching that.

Hi

When there are duplicated repos, available.packages() takes
significantly longer to run.

For example

mirror = "https://cloud.r-project.org/"
system.time(available.packages(repos = mirror))
#   user  system elapsed
# 1.054   0.031   1.245
system.time(available.packages(repos = c(mirror, mirror)))
#   user  system elapsed
# 22.389   0.037  22.429

Best wishes,

If you profile the second run, you will see that the majority of the time is spent in the `tools:::.remove_stale_dups` function, which loops over all duplicated packages - so all packages in that case.
One improvement I could think of is to replace the first line of that function
    pkgs <- ap[, "Package"]
with
    pkgs <- ap[!duplicated(ap[, c("Package", "Version")]), "Package"]
which would help in your example, but the function might still run longer if there are many packages with different versions present, so there maybe even better optimizations.

Stating the obvious here, but since we don't know your 'real' use case, adding a `unique` call to the `repos` argument of the `available.packages` would achieve a similar improvement without any modifications needed from `tools`.

Kind regards,
Maxim Nazarov

The use case came from the rig application
(https://github.com/r-lib/rig). Rig (I think) inserts the RStudio
package manager into the list of repos. This can cause duplication in
repos, hence the current issue.
Now that I know the reason, I can work around it.

Thanks for reporting this issue.  I just changed available.packages() a
la

-    for(repos in contriburl) {
+    for(repos in unique(contriburl)) {

which avoids the full duplication.

Subject: [Rd] Should package version requirements assume installation from
 sources?
Message-ID: <b3e53fa9-b0e0-a8c8-147a-c1c56348f3e9@gmail.com>

[Arguably also appropriate for R-package-devel, but posted to R-devel
     as the discussion is aimed primarily at "experts" ... ]

We, the authors of Matrix, have encountered a somewhat subtle issue
induced by caching of S4 classes and methods in package namespaces.

The namespaces of three reverse dependent packages (SeuratObject, conText,
mcmcsae) cache the formal definition of our virtual class Matrix (and some
subclasses).  For example:

 > ns <- asNamespace("SeuratObject")
 > grep("^[.]__C__.*Matrix$", names(ns), value = TRUE)
[1] ".__C__dMatrix"       ".__C__compMatrix"    ".__C__AnyMatrix"
[4] ".__C__generalMatrix" ".__C__CsparseMatrix" ".__C__sparseMatrix"
[7] ".__C__dsparseMatrix" ".__C__Matrix"

The cached definition (which includes a _validity method_) is obtained from
the version of Matrix available when the reverse dependent package was built
from sources.  For example, if SeuratObject was built under Matrix 1.4-1,
then we get:

 > getValidity(ns$.__C__Matrix)
function (object)
{
     if (!isTRUE(r <- .Call(Dim_validate, object, "Matrix")))
         r
     else .Call(dimNames_validate, object)
}
<bytecode: 0x11e7ca508>
<environment: namespace:Matrix>

whereas if SeuratObject was built under Matrix >= 1.5-0, then we get:

 > getValidity(ns$.__C__Matrix)
function (object)
.Call(Matrix_validate, object)
<bytecode: 0x107dc1698>
<environment: namespace:Matrix>

There are two "questions" here:

1.  The symbol 'Matrix_validate' is not defined until Matrix 1.5-0.
     Is it necessary, for this reason alone, for SeuratObject to have
     'Imports: Matrix (>= 1.5-0)'?  Or can SeuratObject continue using
     'Imports: Matrix (>= 1.3-3)', at the risk of errors like

     > Error: object 'Matrix_validate' not found

     (as already seen here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73700130)?

     Note that this error would not occur for anyone installing SeuratObject
     from sources, unless they decide to _downgrade_ Matrix after doing so.
     Hence this primarily concerns Windows and macOS where R users would
     typically install a binary built by CRAN (i.e., not on their system).

     We are aware that package TMB tests in .onLoad() that the current Matrix
     version is equal to or greater than the version available at build time,
     thus avoiding a "strict" version requirement, but do not want this practice
     to spread ...

2.  For how long should Matrix retain the superceded 'Dim_validate' and
     'dimNames_validate', in order to ensure that "stale" cached validity
     methods continue to work?

We hope that this discussion will highlight the potential ramifications
of importing classes and methods from other packages, and having one's
classes and methods imported _by_ other packages, especially for version
requirements.

FWIW this happens all the time in Bioconductor, where S4 is used very 
intensively, when we make that kind of change to a core infrastructure 
package. Then a bunch of Windows and Mac binary packages need to be 
rebuilt because they contain cached stuff that is now out-of-sync with 
the new state of affairs. The way we deal with this is by bumping the 
version numbers of all the affected packages. This triggers automatic 
rebuilt and propagation of the new binaries.

Note that these problems also affect packages that were already 
installed on the user machines _prior_ to the changes to the upstream 
package. Because the caching we are talking about is actually in the 
package installation folder (and the fact that it ends up in the 
binaries is just a consequence of that). So even on a system where 
packages are installed from source, the affected packages need to be 
reinstalled. Bumping the version numbers of all the affected packages 
also solves that.

I don't see how this could be handled or mitigated via package requirements.

   Interesting.

   How is the version number bumping communicated back to package 
maintainers? Or is there a rule like "third digit-blocks of package 
versions are reserved for Bioconductor modifications" ?

R uses a bunch of elements from the Debian package graph, namely

 Depends/Imports,
 Recommends,
 Suggests 
 Enhances (even if rarely used)

We may need to think about _the other direction_ via

 Breaks

where here, in Mikael's case, we could possibly say that Matrix: has a
Breaks: on the current (known, built with previous Matrix) packages
SeuratObject, conText, mcmcsae (each with a <= set to their current CRAN
version).  This would ensure that when Matrix updates, those packages also
update.

But it gets trickier because Debian can differentiate between an (upstream
source version), say, Matrix 1.5-1 _and its build versions_, say 1.5-1-1 so
the breakage would be of 1.5-1-1 but resolved by a new binary 1.5-1-2 which
sorts higher.  We don't have that, so maybe we cannot do the Breaks with
proper ordering. BioConductor can because of how it releases, CRAN cannot as
it does alter version numbers, only Maintainers do.

So maybe we need a few field in DESCRIPTION to tag 'RecommendedRebuilds'?
Or maybe CRAN would get a right to do an incremental release, so say 'my'
digest 0.6.29 would become 0.6.29.1 ?  But how to communicate this _in
general_ back to Maintainers?

Obviousy for binary packages we can cover this at the repo level, and CRAN
generally does but there are also 'from source' users out we should cover
here. So in short that is an open issue with no clear solution.

And all of this would of course require new and changed tooling.  As we often
maybe this too is something best tried first at package level via opt-in
alternatives to the functions in base package tools and utils.

Mikael,

first about the macOS part of the issue: the first step is that you can tell me and I can trigger a full re-build. For performance reasons the macOS build system does not do full reverse builds, because they take too long as small updates in popular packages can trigger large portions of CRAN needing a re-build - in most cases with no benefit.

Now, that still only addresses one part where the users can upgrade to re-built versions __if they are aware__. However, they would have to know and do it explicitly, because a regular update.packages() would not re-install such reverse-dependent packages since their version has not changed. Therefore I would strongly suggest making sure that updates are backward-compatible, because there is simply no way around that problem as users have no way of knowing that an upgrade of Matrix requires re-installation of many other packages. In fact for Matrix I would argue that such breaking changes should only be allowed with major R release since at that point all packages have to be reinstalled by definition anyway.  So to answer your second part of the question: until next major (=annual) release.

Note that this problem can exist in both directions - even if you upgrade Matrix, if a dependent package is build against newer Matrix __but does not require the newer version__ then the user doesn't know that the installed version is incompatible, so you have to guard in both directions.

Cheers,
Simon

This sounds like a bug or bad design in the S4 system, i.e. caching 
things without a way to detect or update when the cache becomes stale.

Is it really necessary to cache things as part of the binary package, or 
could they be put in place when needed using lazy loading, getting a 
copy from the loaded copy of Matrix?

In practice, when you have a package in Bioconductor, we set up a
bioconductor git repository for the package, which is what is being used to
build Bioc. So we have

bioc git <- used for binary building
optionally, package devel git repos (typically on github)

If "we" (Bioconductor) can then choose to change things in the bioc git
which is upstream of the package devel git. So when Herve changes things to
basic S4 classes, when updating my packages, I pull those changes into my
github repos and merge them.

Regarding version numbers, the rule is that we have three digits x.y.z. We
release Bioc bi-annually and say we release package at version 1.2.0 as
part of Biocondctor 3.15. After release, we bump the version number for
devel, so we create 1.3.0 which only exists in Bioc-devel. Then over time
the developer bumps z as changes are made in devel. Then say we end up at
1.3.17. At release time, this now gets made into 1.4.0.

So we have potentially tons of version bumping where there is no change in
code. This may sound chaotic, but it is being helped by the notion of a
simultaneous release every 6 months. So most users only see 1.2.0 and 1.4.0
(which could be identical but dependencies are likely to change). Once you
understand it, it is a pretty good system IMO, since - for example - I can
immediately see if a package is from devel (odd y) or release (even y). It
does go againsts some people's arbitrary instincts regarding version
numbering; here it also helps that these rules are essentially enforced
across all packages.

Best,
Kasper

Subject: [Rd] Respecting custom repositories files in interactive/batch R
 sessions
Message-ID: <CAD4oTHEoUDsL91EiwAOUYoNv0LkeucZFNUYPgLK3=3iOKwrFYw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

A company I work with mirrors CRAN internally behind its firewall for
security (and reproducibility/consistency/etc) reasons. In that case, we
would like all R processes (across all the R CMD *, as well as interactive
and batch sessions) to automatically hit our cran mirror instead of
prompting the user to select a mirror or failing to contact CRAN at all
(during check).

I recently found out about the ${R_HOME}/etc/repositories file (after
multiple years owning the R installations of a sizable corporate research
outfit in my previous job).

Contrary to my expectations, however, the CRAN entry found in the
repositories file is not respected in interactive or batch sessions.

With the value "https://fakeyfakeyfake" for the CRAN URL, I get this
behavior in an interactive session in Rdevel built from trunk:

R Under development (unstable) (2022-09-14 r82853) -- "Unsuffered
Consequences"


<snip>


> available.packages()

--- Please select a CRAN mirror for use in this session ---

Secure CRAN mirrors


 <snip>


Selection: 0

*Error in contrib.url(repos, type) : *

*  trying to use CRAN without setting a mirror*

> readLines(file.path(R.home(), "etc", "repositories"))

 <snip>

[12] "CRAN\tCRAN\t\*"https://fakeyfakeyfake
<https://fakeyfakeyfake>\"*\tTRUE\tTRUE\tTRUE\tTRUE"
  <snip>


R CMD check, on the other hand, *does* use it the entry in repositories out
of the box:


gabrielbecker$ Rdevel CMD check switchr_0.14.5.tar.gz

[1]
"/Users/gabrielbecker/local/Rdevelraw/R.framework/Versions/4.3/Resources/library"

* using log directory ?/Users/gabrielbecker/gabe/checkedout/switchr.Rcheck?

* using R Under development (unstable) (2022-09-14 r82853)

* using platform: x86_64-apple-darwin21.5.0 (64-bit)

* using session charset: UTF-8

* checking for file ?switchr/DESCRIPTION? ... OK

* checking extension type ... Package

* this is package ?switchr? version ?0.14.5?

* checking package namespace information ... OK

* checking package dependencies ...Warning: unable to access index for
repository https://fakeyfakeyfake/src/contrib:

  cannot open URL 'https://fakeyfakeyfake/src/contrib/PACKAGES'


This behavior is coming from the fact that the repos option is unilaterally
set to c(CRAN = "@CRAN@") in utils::.onLoad


I propose instead that this should be set to either a) the CRAN entry to
the repository file, or even better imho, b) the set of all repos marked as
default in the repositories file, with a caveat that its set to @CRAN@ in
the case there is no cran entry, though comments around the source code in
tools suggest other things will break in that case anyway.

The default value of the repositories file has @CRAN@ for the cran entry,
and cran is the only repo marked as default, so this preserves the existing
behavior in what I assume to be the overwhelming majority of cases where
the repositories file is either not custom, or is only appended to .

I have a patch which does option (b) (and can easily be adapted to option
(a)) that I will submit to bugzilla after any discussion here.

Also, as a separate issue, I strongly feel that the R administration manual
section about repositories be updated to more clearly describe behavior and
best practices around setting the repos R will look in. I will develop a
patch for that separately once I see whether one of the above changes is
likely to go in or not (as I don't want to write it twice).

For completeness, I know that we could put a setRepositories call in the
the site Rprofile, but I have to admit I don't really understand why this
should be necessary.

Thoughts?

I may be missing something here but aren't you overcomplicating things?  One
can avoid the repetitive dialog by setting   options(repos)   accordingly,
and I have long done so.  The Debian (and hence Ubuntu and other derivatives)
package does so via the Rprofile.site I ship.  See e.g. here

 https://sources.debian.org/src/r-base/4.2.1-2/debian/Rprofile.site/

I have used the same mechanism to point to intra-company repositories, easily
a decade or so ago. I had no problems with R CMD check of in-house packages
using this.

Subject: [Rd] Time to drop globalenv() from searches in package code?
Message-ID: <0bc42d07-d897-2807-0da2-eab959d35a2a@gmail.com>

The author of this Stackoverflow question 
https://stackoverflow.com/q/73722496/2554330 got confused because a typo 
in his code didn't trigger an error in normal circumstances, but it did 
when he ran his code in pkgdown.

The typo was to use "x" in a test, when the local variable was named 
".x".  There was no "x" defined locally or in the package or its 
imports, so the search got all the way to the global environment and 
found one.  (The very confusing part for this user was that it found the 
right variable.)

This author had suppressed the "R CMD check" check for use of global 
variables.  Obviously he shouldn't have done that, but he's working with 
tidyverse NSE, and that causes so many false positives that it is 
somewhat understandable he would suppress one too many.

The pkgdown simulation of code in examples doesn't do perfect mimicry of 
running it at top level; the fake global environment never makes it onto 
the search list.  Some might call this a bug, but I'd call it the right 
search strategy.

My suggestion is that the search for variables in package code should 
never get to globalenv().  The chain of environments should stop after 
handling the imports.  (Probably base package functions should also be 
implicitly imported, but nothing else.)

I suspect this change would reveal errors in lots of packages, but the 
number of legitimate uses of the current search strategy has got to be 
pretty small nowadays, since we've been getting warnings for years about 
implicit imports from other standard packages.

Hi Dirk,

So there's a couple of things going on. First off you're correct that that
works generally. There are a couple of reasons that made it not. The first
is a bug/design error in Rstudio which is causing the R_PROFILE to not be
adhered to when you build there. I will be filing a bug regarding that with
them, as I know that is irrelevant to this list.  There was some indication
that even raw R CMD check running via an R studio server installation was
missing the profile, but that ended up being spurious upon deeper testing.

That said, I do think that there is a case to be made for the ability to
modify what repositories R knows about at a more fundamental level than
setting options in a site profile, and that is, ostensibly, what the
repositories file machinery does. I understand it was intended initially
and is currently only (?) used for the windows repository gui menu and
related setRepositories function, but I still think there is some value in
extending it in the ways I described.

One major difference is that in this case, even when run with --vanilla,
administrators would still be in control of which repositories users hit
(by default only, of course, but there is still value in that).

Best,
~G

Friends,

I always keep forgetting how these things currently/precisely work, but
I guess the principle is that utils:::.onLoad() does

  options(repos = c(CRAN = "@CRAN@"))

unless the repos option was already set (in the user or site profiles).
As the latter are not used when checking, the check code in tools takes
advantage of the repositories file mechanism, see ? setRepositories:

     The default list of known repositories is stored in the file
     ?R_HOME/etc/repositories?.  That file can be edited for a site, or
     a user can have a personal copy in the file pointed to by the
     environment variable ?R_REPOSITORIES?, or if this is unset or does
     not exist, in ?HOME/.R/repositories?, which will take precedence.

which also points to Startup etc).

I guess one could teach utils:::.onLoad() to use the user/site
repositories setting instead of the hard-wired CRAN = @CRAN@?  Afaict,
that would make no difference if the repositories file was not
configured, and provide the configured setting in case repos was not set
in the user/site profile ...

Hello,

Why doesn't the comma throw an error?


plot(1:5,)    # works, no complaints


Shouldn't this be considered a bug? I would expect the parser to at 
least give a warning.

That may actually be the case for EVERY default plot, if I understand
correctly. The default S# plot is defined as

## Default S3 method:
plot(x, y = NULL, type = "p",  xlim = NULL, ylim = NULL,
     log = "", main = NULL, sub = NULL, xlab = NULL, ylab = NULL,
     ann = par("ann"), axes = TRUE, frame.plot = axes,
     panel.first = NULL, panel.last = NULL, asp = NA,
     xgap.axis = NA, ygap.axis = NA,
     ...)

By putting in the comma, unless I am mistaken, you are effectively
saying the second element is NULL, which is how it's naturally
defined.

Thanks,

Avi

No, in f(x,) the second argument is missing, not NULL.

That says the second argument is missing.

You need this to enter missing arguments with positional matching, e.g.

f(a, , b)

sets the second argument of f() to missing, but the third is set to b.

Subject: [Rd] sessionInfo() errors when an attached package is removed from
 the library
Message-ID: <CA+6hu7cW_+wrZd3jOW9gZky0SN=otFNqocE1BU-hvQuY8vUksQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I noticed that sessionInfo() results in an error when you remove a package
from the library that was previously attached:

library(xyz)
> remove.packages("xyz")
> #> Removing package from
> '/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.2-arm64/Resources/library'
> #> (as 'lib' is unspecified)
> sessionInfo()
> #> Warning in FUN(X[[i]], ...): DESCRIPTION file of package 'xyz' is
> #> missing or broken
> #> Error in x$Priority: $ operator is invalid for atomic vectors


If it was only loaded, only "loaded via a namespace" section fails to print
with the same error message.

Notice that this is not an issue for the {sessioninfo} package that only
warns you in a friendly way that the particular package was removed from
the library, without any errors.

The problem occurs when sessionInfo calls packageDescription on each
package on the search path.

Best,
Jan

Hello,

Duncan is right, his example convince me. With a function like `[` it's 
frequent to have the second argument missing.

So, no error. Thanks to Avraham, Bill and Duncan.

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

As a general matter, empty arguments are allowed and are used meaningfully in some contexts, notably A[i,], which is syntactic sugarcoating of "["(A,i,).

I.e., these are different:

> "["(Sigma,2,) # 2nd row
[1] 0.077 0.168
> "["(Sigma,2) # 2nd element
[1] 0.077


It is somewhat rare to have an empty last argument, intermediate ones are more common:

> seq(0,1,,5)
[1] 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00

Precisely, that is my proposal. I have a patch which does this and passes
make check-devel for me (there is some slight technical gotchas because
tools::get_repositories calls utils::read.delim which isn't available yet
during utils::onLoad execution), but I have a workaround for that that
works.

If the consensus is that this is a good idea I'm more than happy to submit
the patch, along with an update to the admin manual reflecting the change
(either together or as separate issues).

Best,
~G

This was considered and discussed when I added namespaces. Basically
it would mean making the parent of the base namespace environment be
the empty environment instead of the global environment. As a design
this is cleaner, and it would be a one-line change in eval.c.  But
there were technical reasons this was not a viable option at the time,
also a few political reasons. The technical reasons mostly had to do
with S3 dispatch.

Changes over the years, mostly from work Kurt has done, to S3 dispatch
for methods defined and registered in packages might make this more
viable in principle, but there would still be a lot of existing code
that would stop working. For example, 'make check' with the one-line
change fails in a base example that defines an S3 method. It might be
possible to fiddle with the dispatch to keep most of that code
working, but I suspect that would be a lot of work. Seeing what it
would take to get 'make check' to succeed would be a first step if
anyone wants to take a crack at it.

Your definition of 'legitimate' is probably quite similar to mine, but
there is likely to be a small but vocal minority with very different
views :-).

Best,
