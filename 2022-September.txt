Hi,

Did you manage to get to a blog post at some point?

I just saw that there was an live-streaming lecture on August 4th - 
https://sms.wgtn.ac.nz/cgi-bin/seminars?rm=details&id=987

Was this perhaps recorded anywhere?

right, that could be improved. Do you have an example which exhibits the

Both R_check_class_etc and R_check_class_and_super are unfortunately 
exported, the former is used a lot in packages (even though they are not 
mentioned in Writing R Extensions, so actually shouldn't be used in 
packages). Anyway, it would be easier if we could preserve their 
interface and behavior.

Maybe we could support rho==NULL in R_check_class_and_super, the 
environment would be looked up in that case when needed. 
R_check_class_etc would simply only call R_check_class_and_super with 
that argument. I see that R_check_class_and_super uses asChar() on the 
class attribute, while R_check_class_etc does not currently for looking 
for the environment, but I assume doing that in both cases should not 
matter (and it would have to be tested).

So this would be a trivial change, but if you wanted to create a minimal 
patch, I will be happy to have a look.

Best
Tomas

I benchmarked .Call("R_etc", x) for x <- new("dgTMatrix"), after compiling
and loading the following:

```
#include <Rinternals.h>

SEXP R_etc(SEXP x) {
     static const char *valid[] = {"dgCMatrix", "dgRMatrix", "dgTMatrix", ""};
     return ScalarInteger(R_check_class_etc(x, valid));
}
```

R-devel used ~2 microseconds while my patched version of R used ~0.2
microseconds.  So, not a bottleneck by any means.  On the other hand,
'Matrix' and probably other packages do call R_check_class_etc() quite
often, hence my report.

I've implemented essentially what you've described; see attached.

Subject: [Rd] Passing a call as label to text() works differently when the
 call involves paste() vs paste0()
Message-ID: <d6a1ccfe0082445b8f74a32f1e511e48@UM-MAIL3214.unimaas.nl>

Hi all,

Maybe a bit of an esoteric observation, but the second one doesn't work properly:

x <- 2
plot(NA, xlim=c(0,1), ylim=c(0,1))
text(0.5, 0.55, bquote(paste("x =", .(x))))
text(0.5, 0.45, bquote(paste0("x = ", .(x))))

Note that this has nothing to do in particular with bquote(). This is the same issue:

plot(NA, xlim=c(0,1), ylim=c(0,1))
text(0.5, 0.55, as.call(list(quote(paste), "x =", 2)))
text(0.5, 0.45, as.call(list(quote(paste0), "x = ", 2)))

I had a look at C_text in plot.c, but couldn't figure out why the second one is treated differently.

Best,
Wolfgang

You're using plotmath code, which is documented in ?plotmath.

It doesn't execute paste(), it just uses that name for a similar 
operation.  There's no operation named paste0(), so that doesn't work.

The paste() operation doesn't add space, so it's more like paste0() in 
any case.

I see, ideally one would have a real scenario with a real performance 
issue leading to this. With a micro-benchmark, one could come up with 
pretty much arbitrary speedup, so it is harder to judge whether an 
optimization is actually worth the effort, the risk of introducing bugs 
and sometimes the added complexity.

Thanks, I've restored the original behavior with pkg == R_NilValue (note 
rho was R_GlobalEnv), I've used C NULL to mark the special mode when 
"rho" should be found, and I made some small tweaks. I will add after 
more testing, if the results are ok.

Yes.  I _was_ at first thinking about a less artificial example
(and in retrospect I probably should have led with that):

## install.packages("Matrix", repos = "http://R-Forge.R-project.org")
library(Matrix)
n <- 10L
x <- new("dgeMatrix", Dim = c(n, n), x = as.double(seq_len(n^2)))
microbenchmark::microbenchmark(t(x))

where the 't' method calls the C-level unpackedMatrix_transpose(),
which in turn calls R_check_class_etc().

Makes sense - thanks for catching that.

Subject: [Rd] Duplicated mirrors on available packages
Message-ID: <CADbDLZmXY5133qb89vo05eww1VbtkOsUVaeXLzkJo-zRW+SGPw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

When there are duplicated repos, available.packages() takes
significantly longer to run.

For example

mirror = "https://cloud.r-project.org/"
system.time(available.packages(repos = mirror))
#   user  system elapsed
# 1.054   0.031   1.245
system.time(available.packages(repos = c(mirror, mirror)))
#   user  system elapsed
# 22.389   0.037  22.429

Best wishes,

Colin

If you profile the second run, you will see that the majority of the time is spent in the `tools:::.remove_stale_dups` function, which loops over all duplicated packages - so all packages in that case.
One improvement I could think of is to replace the first line of that function
    pkgs <- ap[, "Package"]
with
    pkgs <- ap[!duplicated(ap[, c("Package", "Version")]), "Package"]
which would help in your example, but the function might still run longer if there are many packages with different versions present, so there maybe even better optimizations.

Stating the obvious here, but since we don't know your 'real' use case, adding a `unique` call to the `repos` argument of the `available.packages` would achieve a similar improvement without any modifications needed from `tools`.

Kind regards,
Maxim Nazarov

The use case came from the rig application
(https://github.com/r-lib/rig). Rig (I think) inserts the RStudio
package manager into the list of repos. This can cause duplication in
repos, hence the current issue.
Now that I know the reason, I can work around it.
