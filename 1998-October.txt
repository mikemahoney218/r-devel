Subject: making R-devel on hpux10.20
Message-ID: <13843.30890.223793.897390@c1186.ae.ge.com>


It seems like F77_SYMBOL is needed around "bakslv" in include/FFTab.h
and include/FFDecl.h. I can only make using f2c and need to use
-lCblas NOT -lblas. The system -lblas is also missing some
functions. Cblas works just fine. I have to hand correct LD, F77, and
LIBS in Makeconf and etc/Makeconf after configure.

Osman

As part of preparation for a ``visualization'' course I am supposed to teach
I had a brief play with using the Gimp to capture an on-screen R plot and
then massaging it into something more suitable for magazine publication :-).
You can see the result at

It looks best in truecolor.

Some ideas involving "virtual objects" and database interfaces have
been vented on various occasions, but there are no immediate plans. It
*should* happen at some point, I think, but just now we're busy trying
to get the documentation in sync with the implementation and getting
rid of bugs.

Dear Alexander (and others),

Could we move this more and more technical topic from R-help to R-devel
(where I think it might have better fit even initially)?

During the last day, several people have unsubscribed from R-help,
I assume because they are not interested in Assembler messages...

After changing "config.site" you have to rerun "configure" !

Ok.  Given the  print.coefmat(.) interface,
it would be pretty easy to implement yet another option, let's say

If set to FALSE, it would not print P-values with print.summary.g?lm(.)
but it would print  for  print.anova
	(Here we are talking about  R 0.63, 
	 where print.tabular is not used anymore, see
	 CRAN src/devel/R-devel.tar.gz)

Opinions?

Andrea,

this problem does NOT appear on my (Sun Solaris) version of R 0.62.3.
It must be a "architecture dependent" (maybe Windows only) bug, triggered
by bogous  libraries / optimizations, or such things.

Here is a mail from the R core development list, of half a year ago.
I don't really know the details of what it's about...

Note: This is *NOT* CC'ed to R-help (but to R-devel, the "R code experts")
	with my understanding that finally a SUMMARY

  That's true. I have just checked and compiling src/nmath/fround.c 
  without any optimization seems to give the right `round' under Win32
  (at least on a Win3.1 system).
  I will prepare a bug fixed version of rw0623 in few days
  (this bug, the Alt-Gr keyboard bug,....).
  A question: is it sensible that I prepare the binary distribution
  using R-Release (in spite of R-0.62.3)? I would like to have
  a version with at least the (0+0i)^2 and the seq(..,..,by=) bugs
  fixed. And the easiest way it is to use the Release(ed) source.

Subject: gdb core dump
Message-ID: <98Oct16.113722edt.13469@mailgate.bank-banque-canada.ca>

When I get a segmentation fault and core dump can I use gdb to examine the core
file and get any useful information about why and where things went wrong? Do I
need to compile R in a special way to do this? Obviously I'm a newbie at this.
Details would be appreciated.

Just execute as

R -d gdb

(and type 'run')

In order for this to be as useful as possible you should do it before 
	make install
so that gdb can find the source files and display them for you.

Also, compilers vary in how useful their optimised output is for
debugging. I find that the Sun compiler loses line number information when
optimisation is specified, and just keeps track of which function you are
in. gcc keeps line number information, which makes it better for debugging
purposes.

The problem is that the segmentation faults do not happen in any reliable way,
and usually they occur in batch scripts I use for testing. I was wondering if
there is anyway, after they occur, to recover useful information from the core
file that is generated?

I'm confused. What do I do before make install?

make creates a working version of R locally, make install puts it in eg
/usr/local/, but without the source. Running the debugger on the local
version of R in the source tree can be more useful than running it on the
installed version. This may not be feasible in your set up, and it isn't
critical -- you can still get a stack trace of function calls.

You look at a core file in much the same way, by running gdb through R -d
gdb. The reason to do it that way is to get the environment variables
right.

Thanks. Now I guess that gets me to the hard part. Does the following point out
a problem in R 0.62.3?

Segfaults in the internal R code seem to usually be due to an unprotected
pointer being garbage collected (which is why they are unpredictable --
you don't know when garbage collection will be triggered).  This looks
like one of these.

Unfortunately the only reliable way to find out exactly where it is is to
get a reproducible segfault.  The development version can be set up to
garbage collect at every opportunity, which helps make the problem
reproducible, and then it's possible to track down when the offending
pointer gets mangled and see what wasn't protected. As you can imagine,
it's somewhat time consuming. Quite a few of these bugs have been found
and fixed for 0.63.

Subject: Bug Report? readline...
Message-ID: <01bdfc5c$a4a4daa0$7d0e4c86@wreich>

Hello developers,

I just compiled R 0.62.3 on my Linux-box. However, the R
prompt doesn't seem to use the gnu-readline, but generates
fancy escapes when using the cursor keys.

As I
- have GNU readline installed,
- have run configure with option --enable-readline,
- unsuccessfully have spent half a day browsing through
  the sources in order to find a reason...

...I don't know what went wrong. Is this a bug?

If you can tell me how I can activate the readline,
please mail to my private address (wreich@gwdg.de)

TIA, Wendelin

The most likely explanation is that readline isn't where configure was
looking.  If you do configure without (possibly even with)  
--enable-readline it will try to find the library. If it fails at that
point the file config.log will contain some error messages indicating what
didn't work.

These, together with information on where readline is located and what
version it is, would help diagnose the problem.

Subject: anovalist.lm  or  anova.lmlist?
Message-ID: <199810210647.IAA21798@sophie.ethz.ch>


In R, we currently have  the functions
	anovalist.lm
and	anova.glmlist

S / S-plus has  
	anova.lmlist
	anova.glmlist

On the other hand, the  [n]lme  package (library) of Doug Bates and Jose
Pinheiro has an "lmList" class  and  an  anova.lmList(.) method for that.

We are considering to use

	anovalist.lm
and	anovalist.glm

instead of the  S/S-plus names mentioned above.
These functions are probably never called from top-level by a user
(they *are* called by  anova.lm(.) & anova.glm()).

Doug Bates says
  DB> The name anovalist.lm makes sense in that the method dispatch is on
  DB> only the first object which has a class of "lm" or "glm" or ...  If
  DB> there was an anovalist generic it would be even more consistent.  The
  DB> name anova.lmlist looks like the name of a method but I don't think it
  DB> is treated that way.


Your opinions?

Do you know of S- or R- code (outside or  "R base") which 
call  anova.[g]lmlist directly ?

I've missed them as well.
However, I propose to implement (additionally) 
a more DRASTIC CHANGE :

 attach() and
 library()	--- should check about conflicts and
		   warn on all of them [at least about masking of package:base].
		   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This most probably will suddenly give quite a few warnings for some
contributed packages.

But I think these warnings are important and should help package writers
from accidental overloading.

In S-plus, we've been using a patched version of attach.default
for several years now, and our users have been very glad about it:

attach.default <- function(what = NULL, pos = 2,
			   name = if(is.character(what)) what else
			          if( is.name(TTT <- substitute(what)))
			           as.character(TTT) else "",

If you do this please at least have an argument warn=T, so I can turn it off. I
mask a lot of things on purpose and I don't want to list them every time.

I am in two minds about this. On S I do mask things a lot, and they are to
correct bugs/extend functionality. But S-PLUS is only released
occasionally, and many users have not bought updated versions.  With R I
tend only to mask things when developing replacement code, as I send
suggestions of enhanced versions that are (almost always) accepted
rapidly.  So I think an option to warn would be a good idea, but perhaps
defaulting to off.  With S-PLUS and our users, the problem is usually
long-forgotten objects in the current working directory, whereas I rarely
save R images for more than a few sessions. 

I have now contributed a version  of conflicts() that will appear in 
R-devel and hence 0.63.

Subject: EGCS optimizer bug?
Message-ID: <x2r9vwl1uh.fsf@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>


The current development version dies in qbeta() when compiled with
egcs -O, egcs 1.0.2 and glibc 2.0.7 (RedHat versions). Since this also
kill the F and t distributions, it doesn't exactly do wonders for R's
usefulness...

Anyone else seeing this or has my setup just gone out of whack? It
does look pretty much like a clear compiler bug when inlining math
functions (storing temporaries offset from %ebx, but no setting of
%ebx register to anything useful...)

The following paraphrase on R's qbeta.c appears to be a close to
minimal example of the problem (no, it doesn't do anything useful, and
there are several obvious things wrong with it, but it displays the
%ebx problem, if you look at the generated code):

#include <math.h>

double lbeta(){}

double qbeta(double alpha, double p, double q)
{
        double t,r, logbeta;
        volatile double xinbta;

        logbeta = lbeta(p, q);

        if (p<1) 
                t = r * pow(t, 3.);
        return xinbta;
}

main(){qbeta(.5,.5,.5);}

At what optimization?  I've had various problems with older versions
of EGCS (and have gone back to gcc 2.7.2 except when I must have
reasonable c++ features)

This was with plain -O -- apparently anything that tries to inline
math functions like pow() can get confused.

Anyone tried egcs1.1b?

Subject: package help clobbers R help (html)
Message-ID: <98Oct26.125503est.13464@mailgate.bank-banque-canada.ca>

As with 0.62.3, when I install my dse package with documentation in 0.62.4 the
html help in R/doc/html/function.html gets clobbered so that the regular R
function help is not available. I was postponing a revised version of my dse
library install in the hope that this might be fixed.

Does anyone know if this is a simple problem that I can hope will be fixed soon,
or should I consider a work-around?

Paul Gilbert

P.S. - So far no core dumps and my tests are all working well in 0.62.4. Looks
good!

I did not track this bug down in the 0.62 series because I thought
there would be no such thing as a 0.62.4 ... the original plan was
that the next release would be 0.63 ... but that may now take some
time.

I have changed the html help interface in 0.63 such that all packages
in the current load path are found by linking them into the user's
home directory. Hence it's not such a good idea to mingle around with
0.62.4 help.

The following may be an easy workaround: After R INSTALL do a

	$RHOME/etc/build-help --htmllists

this should rebuild the file functions.html. At least for me this
works always. 

Best,
Fritz

Apparently not... But now I have, and it appears to be OK at -O2. 

Pity that it's 11 MB source and that the defunct 1.0.2 is what ships
on RedHat CD's. [There are binaries on contrib.redhat.com, though. You
could probably make do with 2.8MB (C + g77) of those]

Is 1.0.2 shipped on RedHat 5.2 CD's or are you referring to RH 5.1?

The numbering of egcs under Debian is different.  The version that
will be in Debian 2.1, that release that is currently frozen and being
tested, is numbered 2.91.57 to avoid conflicts with release numbering
in gcc.  It appears that 2.91.57 was derived from a 1.1-prerelease
version of egcs.

5.2 ???? They don't even know that one on ftp.redhat.com. Anyway, 5.1
is what I meant.

Same as 1.1b:
[pd@blueberry R]$ gcc --version
egcs-2.91.57

(this is not a prerelease, the b in 1.1b is the patchlevel.)

It is not though. The full system is 8.5Mb in the preferred bzip2 format, and
C+g77 is 7.0Mb in source. I downloaded the lot in about 30mins to
my home machine.

ecgs release 1.1b reports:

toucan.stats# ./gcc -v
Using builtin specs.
gcc version egcs-2.91.57 19980901 (egcs-1.1 release)

so my guess is that this is the same release.

I have noticed that a (seemingly) idle R process on an NT 4.0 machine
is reported by the task manager as consuming 99% of the CPU cycles.
I am not sure this is a problem since the machine still seems
responsive to other tasks. RJune does not exhibit this behavior.

You can use ESS and either XEmacs 21.0 (currently wrapping up beta) or
NTEmacs, or Emacs(FSF) to edit files.  

IF the mingwin(?) or cygwin versions of R allow for command-line
prompts rather than working within a text-widget thing, then you might
be able to get it to work with some kind of process control.  I really
don't know (cc'd to R-devel and ess-help to see if anyone has this
running?)

One possible solution is to run Linux, of course; but it might not be
feasible.

XLispStat might be workable with _lots_ of work to the emacs hacks
found on Brian Ripley's Windows for Splus World-Wide-Web page.  I've
been working on other aspects of ESS recently, and havn't made the
integration yet, sigh...  (again, if any one wants to give me a
reasonably fast W95/NT box to play with :-)....

Comments from others more than welcome!

Perhaps this has been mentioned and I wasn't paying attention. When I try to
import a postscript file (which is EPS according to the R help on postscript) my
Framemaker filter chokes. If I simply edit the first line of the file to put

%!PS-Adobe-3.0 EPSF-3.0
rather than
%!PS-Adobe-3.0

it works just fine. It sure would be simpler if the postscipt driver put this in
the file.

It shouldn't have to. The PostScript Document Structuring Conventions
allow both forms "%!PS-Adobe-3.0" and "%!PS-Adobe-3.0 EPSF-3.0" with
the rider "Document composition programs should not use these keywords
[namely "EPSF-3.0" and others] when producing a document intended for
printing or display. Instead, they should use only the "%!PS-Adobe-3.0"
comment. Illustration applications may also use the EPSF-3.0 keyword."

Note "may also use". Since an EPS file can be recognised anyway by the
presence of %%BoundingBox somewhere, the EPSF-3.0 is not necessary.

Forcing R to produce "!PS-Adobe-3.0 EPSF-3.0" could break
printing/display software which conforms to the DSC according to the
above quote. The limitations of one program (Framemaker) should not
be used as a reason for producing output which could defeat compliant
software.

However, I wouldn't be against having "EPSF-3.0" as a user-selectable
option.

Best wishes,
Ted.

Given that everyone else has to have filters to correct FrameMaker's PS
exports to be valid EPS, perhaps writing a filter for import to FrameMaker
would be poetic justice.  You make this change by a one-line sed or perl
command.

Sorry, but no, they cannot (see later on the same page as the note you
quoted earlier). Any PostScript file may have %%BoundingBox comment in it,
and many non-EPSF files do (notably those produced by S-PLUS for Windows). 
(Note: I am distinguishing the EPSF file format from EPS files; there are
additional requirements).

It will not defeat properly written DSC-compliant software if it is really
an EPSF file: but see below. Some print spoolers (notably some of HP's) 
fail the caveat in my experience -- even at HP's own labs.

Paul did not tell us which version of R he is using, and the postscript()
driver has been changed in 0.63. However, I believe that if it does produce
a valid EPSF file it should have EPSF-3.0 in the header, and if it does not
it should definitely not.

My belief is that R's postscript() does meet the requirements for EPS, but
the files will be EPSF only if they contain a single plot.  It is not for
nothing that Allan Wilks' S postscript driver has arguments onefile=F,
print.it=F for EPSF files (this means the plots are put in separate files).

BTW, that help page says

     The postscript produced by R is EPS (Encapsulated
     PostScript) compatible, and can be included into other
     documents, e.g. into LaTeX, using
     `\psfig{file=<filename>}'.

and psfig has never been part of LaTeX and has been deprecated by the LaTeX
team since the former LaTeX2e became LaTeX in 1994. The preferred way is
the graphics/graphicx packages; these make the interim epsfig package
defunct.

R 0.63  only  
------------
	(0.62 does not have the print-tests.Rout.save against which to diff!)

I'd be glad if some of you could help us find out some printing/formatting
differences of the same R version on different architectures.

I have the suspiscion that the new glibc aka libc-6 (Linux),
has changed some of the internal printing/formatting code [fprintf ..].

One consequence is that on Debian 2.0 systems,

	(cd tests; make print-tests.Rout)

gives lots of diff output, when it works okay, on Solaris 2.5.x.

If you want help us (R core developers),

1) have a fairly recent version of R-0.63 ["unstable"], or get it from
   CRAN : src/devel/R-devel.tar.gz

2) After "./configure; make" (need now both again), 
   type
	(cd tests; make print-tests.Rout)

   i) If you get no output after the line
	./Rdiff print-tests.Rout ./print-tests.Rout.save
     
       please report something like
	uname -a (and or tell me how your Linux distribution is called)
	gcc -v	 (or the version of your C compiler, if not gcc)

   ii) If you *DO* get diff output after the line
	./Rdiff print-tests.Rout ./print-tests.Rout.save

       send this output -- in addition to the OS / C version (as above)


   ------> Reply to me with these outputs,  I'll summarize to R-devel!


{{ 3) You may also try  

	make check

    which runs much more "tests",  
    and report to  R-core@stat.math.ethz.ch  if you have problems
}}

Thank you for your support of R development!

Hm? I've been using 

\usepackage{epsf}
...
\epsffile{<filename>}

for ages. Is that one deprecated as well?

Yes, although less than psfig.  I have the converted V&R2 sources
(which used epsf) to graphicx for V&R3 recently.

psfig was very flaky in its internals, but was thought to have a nicer
interface than epsf.  epsfig was a psfig-style interface on (mainly)
epsf internals, but graphics/x really is a lot better.  (Especially as
it is the only mechanism that works with pdf files, relevant here if
you want to convert eps to pdf for inclusion by pdftex.)

I've just checked: Lamport 2ed only has graphics/x documented, and it is the
preferred package of the LaTeX Graphics Companion.

Look at the epslatex.ps document on CTAN for the history, and the delights
of graphics/x.

Yep -- at least one version (maybe 95?  havn't looked since :-) was a
wrapper to either the graphics or graphicx package.

Yes, but Framemaker is owned by Adobe, so there is also some chance they're
doing it right, although that has never been a guarantee.

I'm using R 0.62.4 and a fairly recent version of Framemaker (5.5.6).

I could write my own little filter as Brian suggested, but I thought other
people were probably having this problem too. If putting this in would break
other application's filters then perhaps Ted Harding's suggestion of having
"EPSF-3.0" as a user selectable option is the best answer.

Message-ID: <13843.30890.223793.897390@c1186.ae.ge.com>


It seems like F77_SYMBOL is needed around "bakslv" in include/FFTab.h
and include/FFDecl.h. I can only make using f2c and need to use
-lCblas NOT -lblas. The system -lblas is also missing some
functions. Cblas works just fine. I have to hand correct LD, F77, and
LIBS in Makeconf and etc/Makeconf after configure.

As part of preparation for a ``visualization'' course I am supposed to teach
I had a brief play with using the Gimp to capture an on-screen R plot and
then massaging it into something more suitable for magazine publication :-).
You can see the result at

It looks best in truecolor.

Some ideas involving "virtual objects" and database interfaces have
been vented on various occasions, but there are no immediate plans. It
*should* happen at some point, I think, but just now we're busy trying
to get the documentation in sync with the implementation and getting
rid of bugs.

Dear Alexander (and others),

Could we move this more and more technical topic from R-help to R-devel
(where I think it might have better fit even initially)?

During the last day, several people have unsubscribed from R-help,
I assume because they are not interested in Assembler messages...

After changing "config.site" you have to rerun "configure" !

Ok.  Given the  print.coefmat(.) interface,
it would be pretty easy to implement yet another option, let's say

If set to FALSE, it would not print P-values with print.summary.g?lm(.)
but it would print  for  print.anova
	(Here we are talking about  R 0.63, 
	 where print.tabular is not used anymore, see
	 CRAN src/devel/R-devel.tar.gz)

Opinions?

Andrea,

this problem does NOT appear on my (Sun Solaris) version of R 0.62.3.
It must be a "architecture dependent" (maybe Windows only) bug, triggered
by bogous  libraries / optimizations, or such things.

Here is a mail from the R core development list, of half a year ago.
I don't really know the details of what it's about...

Note: This is *NOT* CC'ed to R-help (but to R-devel, the "R code experts")
	with my understanding that finally a SUMMARY

  That's true. I have just checked and compiling src/nmath/fround.c 
  without any optimization seems to give the right `round' under Win32
  (at least on a Win3.1 system).
  I will prepare a bug fixed version of rw0623 in few days
  (this bug, the Alt-Gr keyboard bug,....).
  A question: is it sensible that I prepare the binary distribution
  using R-Release (in spite of R-0.62.3)? I would like to have
  a version with at least the (0+0i)^2 and the seq(..,..,by=) bugs
  fixed. And the easiest way it is to use the Release(ed) source.

Subject: gdb core dump
Message-ID: <98Oct16.113722edt.13469@mailgate.bank-banque-canada.ca>

When I get a segmentation fault and core dump can I use gdb to examine the core
file and get any useful information about why and where things went wrong? Do I
need to compile R in a special way to do this? Obviously I'm a newbie at this.
Details would be appreciated.

Just execute as

R -d gdb

(and type 'run')

In order for this to be as useful as possible you should do it before 
	make install
so that gdb can find the source files and display them for you.

Also, compilers vary in how useful their optimised output is for
debugging. I find that the Sun compiler loses line number information when
optimisation is specified, and just keeps track of which function you are
in. gcc keeps line number information, which makes it better for debugging
purposes.

The problem is that the segmentation faults do not happen in any reliable way,
and usually they occur in batch scripts I use for testing. I was wondering if
there is anyway, after they occur, to recover useful information from the core
file that is generated?

I'm confused. What do I do before make install?

make creates a working version of R locally, make install puts it in eg
/usr/local/, but without the source. Running the debugger on the local
version of R in the source tree can be more useful than running it on the
installed version. This may not be feasible in your set up, and it isn't
critical -- you can still get a stack trace of function calls.

You look at a core file in much the same way, by running gdb through R -d
gdb. The reason to do it that way is to get the environment variables
right.

Thanks. Now I guess that gets me to the hard part. Does the following point out
a problem in R 0.62.3?

Segfaults in the internal R code seem to usually be due to an unprotected
pointer being garbage collected (which is why they are unpredictable --
you don't know when garbage collection will be triggered).  This looks
like one of these.

Unfortunately the only reliable way to find out exactly where it is is to
get a reproducible segfault.  The development version can be set up to
garbage collect at every opportunity, which helps make the problem
reproducible, and then it's possible to track down when the offending
pointer gets mangled and see what wasn't protected. As you can imagine,
it's somewhat time consuming. Quite a few of these bugs have been found
and fixed for 0.63.

Subject: Bug Report? readline...
Message-ID: <01bdfc5c$a4a4daa0$7d0e4c86@wreich>

Hello developers,

I just compiled R 0.62.3 on my Linux-box. However, the R
prompt doesn't seem to use the gnu-readline, but generates
fancy escapes when using the cursor keys.

As I
- have GNU readline installed,
- have run configure with option --enable-readline,
- unsuccessfully have spent half a day browsing through
  the sources in order to find a reason...

...I don't know what went wrong. Is this a bug?

If you can tell me how I can activate the readline,
please mail to my private address (wreich@gwdg.de)

TIA, Wendelin

The most likely explanation is that readline isn't where configure was
looking.  If you do configure without (possibly even with)  
--enable-readline it will try to find the library. If it fails at that
point the file config.log will contain some error messages indicating what
didn't work.

These, together with information on where readline is located and what
version it is, would help diagnose the problem.

Subject: anovalist.lm  or  anova.lmlist?
Message-ID: <199810210647.IAA21798@sophie.ethz.ch>


In R, we currently have  the functions
	anovalist.lm
and	anova.glmlist

S / S-plus has  
	anova.lmlist
	anova.glmlist

On the other hand, the  [n]lme  package (library) of Doug Bates and Jose
Pinheiro has an "lmList" class  and  an  anova.lmList(.) method for that.

We are considering to use

	anovalist.lm
and	anovalist.glm

instead of the  S/S-plus names mentioned above.
These functions are probably never called from top-level by a user
(they *are* called by  anova.lm(.) & anova.glm()).

Doug Bates says
  DB> The name anovalist.lm makes sense in that the method dispatch is on
  DB> only the first object which has a class of "lm" or "glm" or ...  If
  DB> there was an anovalist generic it would be even more consistent.  The
  DB> name anova.lmlist looks like the name of a method but I don't think it
  DB> is treated that way.


Your opinions?

Do you know of S- or R- code (outside or  "R base") which 
call  anova.[g]lmlist directly ?

I've missed them as well.
However, I propose to implement (additionally) 
a more DRASTIC CHANGE :

 attach() and
 library()	--- should check about conflicts and
		   warn on all of them [at least about masking of package:base].
		   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This most probably will suddenly give quite a few warnings for some
contributed packages.

But I think these warnings are important and should help package writers
from accidental overloading.

In S-plus, we've been using a patched version of attach.default
for several years now, and our users have been very glad about it:

attach.default <- function(what = NULL, pos = 2,
			   name = if(is.character(what)) what else
			          if( is.name(TTT <- substitute(what)))
			           as.character(TTT) else "",

If you do this please at least have an argument warn=T, so I can turn it off. I
mask a lot of things on purpose and I don't want to list them every time.

I am in two minds about this. On S I do mask things a lot, and they are to
correct bugs/extend functionality. But S-PLUS is only released
occasionally, and many users have not bought updated versions.  With R I
tend only to mask things when developing replacement code, as I send
suggestions of enhanced versions that are (almost always) accepted
rapidly.  So I think an option to warn would be a good idea, but perhaps
defaulting to off.  With S-PLUS and our users, the problem is usually
long-forgotten objects in the current working directory, whereas I rarely
save R images for more than a few sessions. 

I have now contributed a version  of conflicts() that will appear in 
R-devel and hence 0.63.

Subject: EGCS optimizer bug?
Message-ID: <x2r9vwl1uh.fsf@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>


The current development version dies in qbeta() when compiled with
egcs -O, egcs 1.0.2 and glibc 2.0.7 (RedHat versions). Since this also
kill the F and t distributions, it doesn't exactly do wonders for R's
usefulness...

Anyone else seeing this or has my setup just gone out of whack? It
does look pretty much like a clear compiler bug when inlining math
functions (storing temporaries offset from %ebx, but no setting of
%ebx register to anything useful...)

The following paraphrase on R's qbeta.c appears to be a close to
minimal example of the problem (no, it doesn't do anything useful, and
there are several obvious things wrong with it, but it displays the
%ebx problem, if you look at the generated code):

#include <math.h>

double lbeta(){}

double qbeta(double alpha, double p, double q)
{
        double t,r, logbeta;
        volatile double xinbta;

        logbeta = lbeta(p, q);

        if (p<1) 
                t = r * pow(t, 3.);
        return xinbta;
}

main(){qbeta(.5,.5,.5);}

At what optimization?  I've had various problems with older versions
of EGCS (and have gone back to gcc 2.7.2 except when I must have
reasonable c++ features)

This was with plain -O -- apparently anything that tries to inline
math functions like pow() can get confused.

Anyone tried egcs1.1b?

Subject: package help clobbers R help (html)
Message-ID: <98Oct26.125503est.13464@mailgate.bank-banque-canada.ca>

As with 0.62.3, when I install my dse package with documentation in 0.62.4 the
html help in R/doc/html/function.html gets clobbered so that the regular R
function help is not available. I was postponing a revised version of my dse
library install in the hope that this might be fixed.

Does anyone know if this is a simple problem that I can hope will be fixed soon,
or should I consider a work-around?

Paul Gilbert

P.S. - So far no core dumps and my tests are all working well in 0.62.4. Looks
good!

I did not track this bug down in the 0.62 series because I thought
there would be no such thing as a 0.62.4 ... the original plan was
that the next release would be 0.63 ... but that may now take some
time.

I have changed the html help interface in 0.63 such that all packages
in the current load path are found by linking them into the user's
home directory. Hence it's not such a good idea to mingle around with
0.62.4 help.

The following may be an easy workaround: After R INSTALL do a

	$RHOME/etc/build-help --htmllists

this should rebuild the file functions.html. At least for me this
works always. 

Best,
Fritz

Apparently not... But now I have, and it appears to be OK at -O2. 

Pity that it's 11 MB source and that the defunct 1.0.2 is what ships
on RedHat CD's. [There are binaries on contrib.redhat.com, though. You
could probably make do with 2.8MB (C + g77) of those]

Is 1.0.2 shipped on RedHat 5.2 CD's or are you referring to RH 5.1?

The numbering of egcs under Debian is different.  The version that
will be in Debian 2.1, that release that is currently frozen and being
tested, is numbered 2.91.57 to avoid conflicts with release numbering
in gcc.  It appears that 2.91.57 was derived from a 1.1-prerelease
version of egcs.

5.2 ???? They don't even know that one on ftp.redhat.com. Anyway, 5.1
is what I meant.

Same as 1.1b:
[pd@blueberry R]$ gcc --version
egcs-2.91.57

(this is not a prerelease, the b in 1.1b is the patchlevel.)

It is not though. The full system is 8.5Mb in the preferred bzip2 format, and
C+g77 is 7.0Mb in source. I downloaded the lot in about 30mins to
my home machine.

ecgs release 1.1b reports:

toucan.stats# ./gcc -v
Using builtin specs.
gcc version egcs-2.91.57 19980901 (egcs-1.1 release)

so my guess is that this is the same release.

I have noticed that a (seemingly) idle R process on an NT 4.0 machine
is reported by the task manager as consuming 99% of the CPU cycles.
I am not sure this is a problem since the machine still seems
responsive to other tasks. RJune does not exhibit this behavior.

You can use ESS and either XEmacs 21.0 (currently wrapping up beta) or
NTEmacs, or Emacs(FSF) to edit files.  

IF the mingwin(?) or cygwin versions of R allow for command-line
prompts rather than working within a text-widget thing, then you might
be able to get it to work with some kind of process control.  I really
don't know (cc'd to R-devel and ess-help to see if anyone has this
running?)

One possible solution is to run Linux, of course; but it might not be
feasible.

XLispStat might be workable with _lots_ of work to the emacs hacks
found on Brian Ripley's Windows for Splus World-Wide-Web page.  I've
been working on other aspects of ESS recently, and havn't made the
integration yet, sigh...  (again, if any one wants to give me a
reasonably fast W95/NT box to play with :-)....

Comments from others more than welcome!

Perhaps this has been mentioned and I wasn't paying attention. When I try to
import a postscript file (which is EPS according to the R help on postscript) my
Framemaker filter chokes. If I simply edit the first line of the file to put

%!PS-Adobe-3.0 EPSF-3.0
rather than
%!PS-Adobe-3.0

it works just fine. It sure would be simpler if the postscipt driver put this in
the file.

It shouldn't have to. The PostScript Document Structuring Conventions
allow both forms "%!PS-Adobe-3.0" and "%!PS-Adobe-3.0 EPSF-3.0" with
the rider "Document composition programs should not use these keywords
[namely "EPSF-3.0" and others] when producing a document intended for
printing or display. Instead, they should use only the "%!PS-Adobe-3.0"
comment. Illustration applications may also use the EPSF-3.0 keyword."

Note "may also use". Since an EPS file can be recognised anyway by the
presence of %%BoundingBox somewhere, the EPSF-3.0 is not necessary.

Forcing R to produce "!PS-Adobe-3.0 EPSF-3.0" could break
printing/display software which conforms to the DSC according to the
above quote. The limitations of one program (Framemaker) should not
be used as a reason for producing output which could defeat compliant
software.

However, I wouldn't be against having "EPSF-3.0" as a user-selectable
option.

Best wishes,
Ted.

Given that everyone else has to have filters to correct FrameMaker's PS
exports to be valid EPS, perhaps writing a filter for import to FrameMaker
would be poetic justice.  You make this change by a one-line sed or perl
command.

Sorry, but no, they cannot (see later on the same page as the note you
quoted earlier). Any PostScript file may have %%BoundingBox comment in it,
and many non-EPSF files do (notably those produced by S-PLUS for Windows). 
(Note: I am distinguishing the EPSF file format from EPS files; there are
additional requirements).

It will not defeat properly written DSC-compliant software if it is really
an EPSF file: but see below. Some print spoolers (notably some of HP's) 
fail the caveat in my experience -- even at HP's own labs.

> However, I wouldn't be against having "EPSF-3.0" as a user-selectable

Paul did not tell us which version of R he is using, and the postscript()
driver has been changed in 0.63. However, I believe that if it does produce
a valid EPSF file it should have EPSF-3.0 in the header, and if it does not
it should definitely not.

My belief is that R's postscript() does meet the requirements for EPS, but
the files will be EPSF only if they contain a single plot.  It is not for
nothing that Allan Wilks' S postscript driver has arguments onefile=F,
print.it=F for EPSF files (this means the plots are put in separate files).

BTW, that help page says

     The postscript produced by R is EPS (Encapsulated
     PostScript) compatible, and can be included into other
     documents, e.g. into LaTeX, using
     `\psfig{file=<filename>}'.

and psfig has never been part of LaTeX and has been deprecated by the LaTeX
team since the former LaTeX2e became LaTeX in 1994. The preferred way is
the graphics/graphicx packages; these make the interim epsfig package
defunct.

R 0.63  only  
------------
	(0.62 does not have the print-tests.Rout.save against which to diff!)

I'd be glad if some of you could help us find out some printing/formatting
differences of the same R version on different architectures.

I have the suspiscion that the new glibc aka libc-6 (Linux),
has changed some of the internal printing/formatting code [fprintf ..].

One consequence is that on Debian 2.0 systems,

	(cd tests; make print-tests.Rout)

gives lots of diff output, when it works okay, on Solaris 2.5.x.

If you want help us (R core developers),

1) have a fairly recent version of R-0.63 ["unstable"], or get it from
   CRAN : src/devel/R-devel.tar.gz

2) After "./configure; make" (need now both again), 
   type
	(cd tests; make print-tests.Rout)

   i) If you get no output after the line
	./Rdiff print-tests.Rout ./print-tests.Rout.save
     
       please report something like
	uname -a (and or tell me how your Linux distribution is called)
	gcc -v	 (or the version of your C compiler, if not gcc)

   ii) If you *DO* get diff output after the line
	./Rdiff print-tests.Rout ./print-tests.Rout.save

       send this output -- in addition to the OS / C version (as above)


   ------> Reply to me with these outputs,  I'll summarize to R-devel!


{{ 3) You may also try  

	make check

    which runs much more "tests",  
    and report to  R-core@stat.math.ethz.ch  if you have problems

Thank you for your support of R development!

Hm? I've been using 

\usepackage{epsf}
...
\epsffile{<filename>}

for ages. Is that one deprecated as well?

Yes, although less than psfig.  I have the converted V&R2 sources
(which used epsf) to graphicx for V&R3 recently.

psfig was very flaky in its internals, but was thought to have a nicer
interface than epsf.  epsfig was a psfig-style interface on (mainly)
epsf internals, but graphics/x really is a lot better.  (Especially as
it is the only mechanism that works with pdf files, relevant here if
you want to convert eps to pdf for inclusion by pdftex.)

I've just checked: Lamport 2ed only has graphics/x documented, and it is the
preferred package of the LaTeX Graphics Companion.

Look at the epslatex.ps document on CTAN for the history, and the delights
of graphics/x.

Yep -- at least one version (maybe 95?  havn't looked since :-) was a
wrapper to either the graphics or graphicx package.

Yes, but Framemaker is owned by Adobe, so there is also some chance they're
doing it right, although that has never been a guarantee.

I'm using R 0.62.4 and a fairly recent version of Framemaker (5.5.6).

I could write my own little filter as Brian suggested, but I thought other
people were probably having this problem too. If putting this in would break
other application's filters then perhaps Ted Harding's suggestion of having
"EPSF-3.0" as a user selectable option is the best answer.

It seems like F77_SYMBOL is needed around "bakslv" in include/FFTab.h
and include/FFDecl.h. I can only make using f2c and need to use
-lCblas NOT -lblas. The system -lblas is also missing some
functions. Cblas works just fine. I have to hand correct LD, F77, and
LIBS in Makeconf and etc/Makeconf after configure.

As part of preparation for a ``visualization'' course I am supposed to teach
I had a brief play with using the Gimp to capture an on-screen R plot and
then massaging it into something more suitable for magazine publication :-).
You can see the result at

Some ideas involving "virtual objects" and database interfaces have
been vented on various occasions, but there are no immediate plans. It
*should* happen at some point, I think, but just now we're busy trying
to get the documentation in sync with the implementation and getting
rid of bugs.

Dear Alexander (and others),

Could we move this more and more technical topic from R-help to R-devel
(where I think it might have better fit even initially)?

During the last day, several people have unsubscribed from R-help,
I assume because they are not interested in Assembler messages...

After changing "config.site" you have to rerun "configure" !

Ok.  Given the  print.coefmat(.) interface,

If set to FALSE, it would not print P-values with print.summary.g?lm(.)
but it would print  for  print.anova
	(Here we are talking about  R 0.63, 
	 where print.tabular is not used anymore, see
	 CRAN src/devel/R-devel.tar.gz)

Opinions?

Andrea,

this problem does NOT appear on my (Sun Solaris) version of R 0.62.3.
It must be a "architecture dependent" (maybe Windows only) bug, triggered
by bogous  libraries / optimizations, or such things.

Here is a mail from the R core development list, of half a year ago.
I don't really know the details of what it's about...

Note: This is *NOT* CC'ed to R-help (but to R-devel, the "R code experts")
	with my understanding that finally a SUMMARY

  That's true. I have just checked and compiling src/nmath/fround.c 
  without any optimization seems to give the right `round' under Win32
  (at least on a Win3.1 system).
  I will prepare a bug fixed version of rw0623 in few days
  (this bug, the Alt-Gr keyboard bug,....).
  A question: is it sensible that I prepare the binary distribution
  using R-Release (in spite of R-0.62.3)? I would like to have
  a version with at least the (0+0i)^2 and the seq(..,..,by=) bugs
  fixed. And the easiest way it is to use the Release(ed) source.

Subject: gdb core dump
Message-ID: <98Oct16.113722edt.13469@mailgate.bank-banque-canada.ca>

When I get a segmentation fault and core dump can I use gdb to examine the core
file and get any useful information about why and where things went wrong? Do I
need to compile R in a special way to do this? Obviously I'm a newbie at this.
Details would be appreciated.

Just execute as

R -d gdb

(and type 'run')

In order for this to be as useful as possible you should do it before 
	make install
so that gdb can find the source files and display them for you.

Also, compilers vary in how useful their optimised output is for
debugging. I find that the Sun compiler loses line number information when
optimisation is specified, and just keeps track of which function you are
in. gcc keeps line number information, which makes it better for debugging
purposes.

The problem is that the segmentation faults do not happen in any reliable way,
and usually they occur in batch scripts I use for testing. I was wondering if
there is anyway, after they occur, to recover useful information from the core
file that is generated?

I'm confused. What do I do before make install?

make creates a working version of R locally, make install puts it in eg
/usr/local/, but without the source. Running the debugger on the local
version of R in the source tree can be more useful than running it on the
installed version. This may not be feasible in your set up, and it isn't
critical -- you can still get a stack trace of function calls.

You look at a core file in much the same way, by running gdb through R -d
gdb. The reason to do it that way is to get the environment variables
right.

Thanks. Now I guess that gets me to the hard part. Does the following point out
a problem in R 0.62.3?

Segfaults in the internal R code seem to usually be due to an unprotected
pointer being garbage collected (which is why they are unpredictable --
you don't know when garbage collection will be triggered).  This looks
like one of these.

Unfortunately the only reliable way to find out exactly where it is is to
get a reproducible segfault.  The development version can be set up to
garbage collect at every opportunity, which helps make the problem
reproducible, and then it's possible to track down when the offending
pointer gets mangled and see what wasn't protected. As you can imagine,
it's somewhat time consuming. Quite a few of these bugs have been found
and fixed for 0.63.

Subject: Bug Report? readline...
Message-ID: <01bdfc5c$a4a4daa0$7d0e4c86@wreich>

Hello developers,

I just compiled R 0.62.3 on my Linux-box. However, the R
prompt doesn't seem to use the gnu-readline, but generates
fancy escapes when using the cursor keys.

As I
- have GNU readline installed,
- have run configure with option --enable-readline,
- unsuccessfully have spent half a day browsing through
  the sources in order to find a reason...

...I don't know what went wrong. Is this a bug?

If you can tell me how I can activate the readline,
please mail to my private address (wreich@gwdg.de)

TIA, Wendelin

The most likely explanation is that readline isn't where configure was
looking.  If you do configure without (possibly even with)  
--enable-readline it will try to find the library. If it fails at that
point the file config.log will contain some error messages indicating what
didn't work.

These, together with information on where readline is located and what
version it is, would help diagnose the problem.

Subject: anovalist.lm  or  anova.lmlist?
Message-ID: <199810210647.IAA21798@sophie.ethz.ch>


In R, we currently have  the functions
	anovalist.lm
and	anova.glmlist

S / S-plus has  
	anova.lmlist
	anova.glmlist

On the other hand, the  [n]lme  package (library) of Doug Bates and Jose
Pinheiro has an "lmList" class  and  an  anova.lmList(.) method for that.

We are considering to use

	anovalist.lm
and	anovalist.glm

instead of the  S/S-plus names mentioned above.
These functions are probably never called from top-level by a user
(they *are* called by  anova.lm(.) & anova.glm()).

Doug Bates says
  DB> The name anovalist.lm makes sense in that the method dispatch is on
  DB> only the first object which has a class of "lm" or "glm" or ...  If
  DB> there was an anovalist generic it would be even more consistent.  The
  DB> name anova.lmlist looks like the name of a method but I don't think it
  DB> is treated that way.


Your opinions?

Do you know of S- or R- code (outside or  "R base") which 
call  anova.[g]lmlist directly ?

I've missed them as well.
However, I propose to implement (additionally) 
a more DRASTIC CHANGE :

 attach() and
 library()	--- should check about conflicts and
		   warn on all of them [at least about masking of package:base].
		   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This most probably will suddenly give quite a few warnings for some
contributed packages.

But I think these warnings are important and should help package writers
from accidental overloading.

In S-plus, we've been using a patched version of attach.default
for several years now, and our users have been very glad about it:

attach.default <- function(what = NULL, pos = 2,
			   name = if(is.character(what)) what else
			          if( is.name(TTT <- substitute(what)))
			           as.character(TTT) else "",

If you do this please at least have an argument warn=T, so I can turn it off. I
mask a lot of things on purpose and I don't want to list them every time.

I am in two minds about this. On S I do mask things a lot, and they are to
correct bugs/extend functionality. But S-PLUS is only released
occasionally, and many users have not bought updated versions.  With R I
tend only to mask things when developing replacement code, as I send
suggestions of enhanced versions that are (almost always) accepted
rapidly.  So I think an option to warn would be a good idea, but perhaps
defaulting to off.  With S-PLUS and our users, the problem is usually
long-forgotten objects in the current working directory, whereas I rarely
save R images for more than a few sessions. 

I have now contributed a version  of conflicts() that will appear in 
R-devel and hence 0.63.

Subject: EGCS optimizer bug?
Message-ID: <x2r9vwl1uh.fsf@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>


The current development version dies in qbeta() when compiled with
egcs -O, egcs 1.0.2 and glibc 2.0.7 (RedHat versions). Since this also
kill the F and t distributions, it doesn't exactly do wonders for R's
usefulness...

Anyone else seeing this or has my setup just gone out of whack? It
does look pretty much like a clear compiler bug when inlining math
functions (storing temporaries offset from %ebx, but no setting of
%ebx register to anything useful...)

The following paraphrase on R's qbeta.c appears to be a close to
minimal example of the problem (no, it doesn't do anything useful, and
there are several obvious things wrong with it, but it displays the
%ebx problem, if you look at the generated code):

#include <math.h>

double lbeta(){}

double qbeta(double alpha, double p, double q)
{
        double t,r, logbeta;
        volatile double xinbta;

        logbeta = lbeta(p, q);

        if (p<1) 
                t = r * pow(t, 3.);
        return xinbta;
}

main(){qbeta(.5,.5,.5);}

At what optimization?  I've had various problems with older versions
of EGCS (and have gone back to gcc 2.7.2 except when I must have
reasonable c++ features)

This was with plain -O -- apparently anything that tries to inline
math functions like pow() can get confused.

Anyone tried egcs1.1b?

Subject: package help clobbers R help (html)
Message-ID: <98Oct26.125503est.13464@mailgate.bank-banque-canada.ca>

As with 0.62.3, when I install my dse package with documentation in 0.62.4 the
html help in R/doc/html/function.html gets clobbered so that the regular R
function help is not available. I was postponing a revised version of my dse
library install in the hope that this might be fixed.

Does anyone know if this is a simple problem that I can hope will be fixed soon,
or should I consider a work-around?

Paul Gilbert

P.S. - So far no core dumps and my tests are all working well in 0.62.4. Looks
good!

I did not track this bug down in the 0.62 series because I thought
there would be no such thing as a 0.62.4 ... the original plan was
that the next release would be 0.63 ... but that may now take some
time.

I have changed the html help interface in 0.63 such that all packages
in the current load path are found by linking them into the user's
home directory. Hence it's not such a good idea to mingle around with
0.62.4 help.

The following may be an easy workaround: After R INSTALL do a

	$RHOME/etc/build-help --htmllists

this should rebuild the file functions.html. At least for me this
works always. 

Best,
Fritz

Apparently not... But now I have, and it appears to be OK at -O2. 

Pity that it's 11 MB source and that the defunct 1.0.2 is what ships
on RedHat CD's. [There are binaries on contrib.redhat.com, though. You
could probably make do with 2.8MB (C + g77) of those]

Is 1.0.2 shipped on RedHat 5.2 CD's or are you referring to RH 5.1?

The numbering of egcs under Debian is different.  The version that
will be in Debian 2.1, that release that is currently frozen and being
tested, is numbered 2.91.57 to avoid conflicts with release numbering
in gcc.  It appears that 2.91.57 was derived from a 1.1-prerelease
version of egcs.

5.2 ???? They don't even know that one on ftp.redhat.com. Anyway, 5.1
is what I meant.

Same as 1.1b:
[pd@blueberry R]$ gcc --version
egcs-2.91.57

(this is not a prerelease, the b in 1.1b is the patchlevel.)

It is not though. The full system is 8.5Mb in the preferred bzip2 format, and
C+g77 is 7.0Mb in source. I downloaded the lot in about 30mins to
my home machine.

ecgs release 1.1b reports:

toucan.stats# ./gcc -v
Using builtin specs.
gcc version egcs-2.91.57 19980901 (egcs-1.1 release)

so my guess is that this is the same release.

I have noticed that a (seemingly) idle R process on an NT 4.0 machine
is reported by the task manager as consuming 99% of the CPU cycles.
I am not sure this is a problem since the machine still seems
responsive to other tasks. RJune does not exhibit this behavior.

You can use ESS and either XEmacs 21.0 (currently wrapping up beta) or
NTEmacs, or Emacs(FSF) to edit files.  

IF the mingwin(?) or cygwin versions of R allow for command-line
prompts rather than working within a text-widget thing, then you might
be able to get it to work with some kind of process control.  I really
don't know (cc'd to R-devel and ess-help to see if anyone has this
running?)

One possible solution is to run Linux, of course; but it might not be
feasible.

XLispStat might be workable with _lots_ of work to the emacs hacks
found on Brian Ripley's Windows for Splus World-Wide-Web page.  I've
been working on other aspects of ESS recently, and havn't made the
integration yet, sigh...  (again, if any one wants to give me a
reasonably fast W95/NT box to play with :-)....

Comments from others more than welcome!

Perhaps this has been mentioned and I wasn't paying attention. When I try to
import a postscript file (which is EPS according to the R help on postscript) my
Framemaker filter chokes. If I simply edit the first line of the file to put

%!PS-Adobe-3.0 EPSF-3.0
rather than
%!PS-Adobe-3.0

it works just fine. It sure would be simpler if the postscipt driver put this in
the file.

It shouldn't have to. The PostScript Document Structuring Conventions
allow both forms "%!PS-Adobe-3.0" and "%!PS-Adobe-3.0 EPSF-3.0" with
the rider "Document composition programs should not use these keywords
[namely "EPSF-3.0" and others] when producing a document intended for
printing or display. Instead, they should use only the "%!PS-Adobe-3.0"
comment. Illustration applications may also use the EPSF-3.0 keyword."

Note "may also use". Since an EPS file can be recognised anyway by the
presence of %%BoundingBox somewhere, the EPSF-3.0 is not necessary.

Forcing R to produce "!PS-Adobe-3.0 EPSF-3.0" could break
printing/display software which conforms to the DSC according to the
above quote. The limitations of one program (Framemaker) should not
be used as a reason for producing output which could defeat compliant
software.

However, I wouldn't be against having "EPSF-3.0" as a user-selectable
option.

Best wishes,
Ted.

Given that everyone else has to have filters to correct FrameMaker's PS
exports to be valid EPS, perhaps writing a filter for import to FrameMaker
would be poetic justice.  You make this change by a one-line sed or perl
command.

Sorry, but no, they cannot (see later on the same page as the note you
quoted earlier). Any PostScript file may have %%BoundingBox comment in it,
and many non-EPSF files do (notably those produced by S-PLUS for Windows). 
(Note: I am distinguishing the EPSF file format from EPS files; there are
additional requirements).

It will not defeat properly written DSC-compliant software if it is really
an EPSF file: but see below. Some print spoolers (notably some of HP's) 
fail the caveat in my experience -- even at HP's own labs.

> However, I wouldn't be against having "EPSF-3.0" as a user-selectable

Paul did not tell us which version of R he is using, and the postscript()
driver has been changed in 0.63. However, I believe that if it does produce
a valid EPSF file it should have EPSF-3.0 in the header, and if it does not
it should definitely not.

My belief is that R's postscript() does meet the requirements for EPS, but
the files will be EPSF only if they contain a single plot.  It is not for
nothing that Allan Wilks' S postscript driver has arguments onefile=F,
print.it=F for EPSF files (this means the plots are put in separate files).

BTW, that help page says

     The postscript produced by R is EPS (Encapsulated
     PostScript) compatible, and can be included into other
     documents, e.g. into LaTeX, using
     `\psfig{file=<filename>}'.

and psfig has never been part of LaTeX and has been deprecated by the LaTeX
team since the former LaTeX2e became LaTeX in 1994. The preferred way is
the graphics/graphicx packages; these make the interim epsfig package
defunct.

R 0.63  only  
------------
	(0.62 does not have the print-tests.Rout.save against which to diff!)

I'd be glad if some of you could help us find out some printing/formatting
differences of the same R version on different architectures.

I have the suspiscion that the new glibc aka libc-6 (Linux),
has changed some of the internal printing/formatting code [fprintf ..].

One consequence is that on Debian 2.0 systems,

	(cd tests; make print-tests.Rout)

gives lots of diff output, when it works okay, on Solaris 2.5.x.

If you want help us (R core developers),

1) have a fairly recent version of R-0.63 ["unstable"], or get it from
   CRAN : src/devel/R-devel.tar.gz

2) After "./configure; make" (need now both again), 
   type
	(cd tests; make print-tests.Rout)

   i) If you get no output after the line
	./Rdiff print-tests.Rout ./print-tests.Rout.save
     
       please report something like
	uname -a (and or tell me how your Linux distribution is called)
	gcc -v	 (or the version of your C compiler, if not gcc)

   ii) If you *DO* get diff output after the line
	./Rdiff print-tests.Rout ./print-tests.Rout.save

       send this output -- in addition to the OS / C version (as above)


   ------> Reply to me with these outputs,  I'll summarize to R-devel!


{{ 3) You may also try  

	make check

    which runs much more "tests",  
    and report to  R-core@stat.math.ethz.ch  if you have problems

Thank you for your support of R development!

Hm? I've been using 

\usepackage{epsf}
...
\epsffile{<filename>}

for ages. Is that one deprecated as well?

Yes, although less than psfig.  I have the converted V&R2 sources
(which used epsf) to graphicx for V&R3 recently.

psfig was very flaky in its internals, but was thought to have a nicer
interface than epsf.  epsfig was a psfig-style interface on (mainly)
epsf internals, but graphics/x really is a lot better.  (Especially as
it is the only mechanism that works with pdf files, relevant here if
you want to convert eps to pdf for inclusion by pdftex.)

I've just checked: Lamport 2ed only has graphics/x documented, and it is the
preferred package of the LaTeX Graphics Companion.

Look at the epslatex.ps document on CTAN for the history, and the delights
of graphics/x.

Yep -- at least one version (maybe 95?  havn't looked since :-) was a
wrapper to either the graphics or graphicx package.

Yes, but Framemaker is owned by Adobe, so there is also some chance they're
doing it right, although that has never been a guarantee.

I'm using R 0.62.4 and a fairly recent version of Framemaker (5.5.6).

I could write my own little filter as Brian suggested, but I thought other
people were probably having this problem too. If putting this in would break
other application's filters then perhaps Ted Harding's suggestion of having
