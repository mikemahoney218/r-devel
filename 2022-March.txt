Thank you Bill! I'll test it out.
That's a kind of instruction I had in mind when I wrote about
extending the relevant part of "Writing R extensions"...

Ideally I'd prefer to be able to run a test locally before "harassing"
other people on the internet, but that's a good point Tomas, thank
you. For some reason the existence of r-pkg-devel escaped me...

Subject: [Rd] message(<cond>) and warning(<cond>) circumvent calling

Message-ID: <CAFDcVCTBnYeL_7Gi17b8azZXyybTK7LZ380bb8Ko5EaqB2R0ow@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, in help("message", package = "base"), we can read:

Description: 'message' is used for generating 'simple' diagnostic
messages which are neither warnings nor errors, but nevertheless
represented as conditions.

>From this, I conclude that message() should generate a condition that
are neither warning nor errors.

However, the following signals a condition of class 'error':

> e <- simpleError("boom!\n")
> message(e)
boom!

This can be seen if we do:

> res <- tryCatch(message(e), condition = identity)
> res
<simpleError: boom!

This stems from message(e) using signalCondition(e) internally.

Another problem with this behavior is that message(e) cannot be suppressed:

> suppressMessages(message(e))
boom!

or captured with calling handlers, e.g.

> res <- withCallingHandlers(message(e), condition = identity)
boom!
> res
NULL

If we replace e <- simpleError("boom") with e <-
simpleWarning("careful"), we see a similar behavior.  These problems
exist also with warning(e).  The current behaviors prevent functions
from capturing and relaying message(<error>), message(<warning>), and
warning(<error>).

I'm happy to post a bug report to <https://bugs.r-project.org/>.

/Henrik

PS. BTW, it looks like some recent "..." tweaks to the warning() and
stop() code could be applied also to message().

Hi,

There is the same issue with stop():

> w <- simpleWarning("careful")
> tryCatch(stop(w), condition = identity)
<simpleWarning: careful>

I very recently stumbled upon this, when a warning was re-raised as an error, which was then not caught by an outer try():

> try(
+   tryCatch(warning("careful"), warning = function(w) stop(w)),
+   silent = TRUE
+ )
Error in doTryCatch(return(expr), name, parentenv, handler) : careful

I would also like to see this behavior changed. I think that stop() should always signal an error, warning() a warning and message() a message.

Best,
Andreas

This is behaving as documented and as intended. If you want to
call stop() with a condition argument and you want to have that
condition handled as an error then you need to make sure that your
condition inherits from "error". One way to do this would be to define
something like

warningToError <- function(w)
    errorCondition(conditionMessage(w),
                   warning = w,
 		  class = "warningToError")

and use stop(warningToError(w)).

If you call stop() with a condition argument then that is the
condition stop() will signal, regardless of its class. I can't at the
moment think of a good reason why I would want to call stop() with a
warning condition argument, and I suspect most cases where that
happens would be mistakes. So checking in stop() that a condition
argument inherits from "error" and signaling a warning, or maybe an
error, if it does not might be worth considering (with analogous
changes for warning() and message()).

The condition system separates the signaling protocol from the process
of determining handlers. Signaling itself is done by
signalCondition().  message() and warning() signal a condition with a
muffle restart available, and return if the condition is not handled.
stop() is guaranteed not to return; if the condition is not handled,
then it invokes the default error handler, which will not return. None
of these currently look at the class of the condition.
signalCondition() looks at the condition's class to find out what
handlers are available. It will invoke error handlers for error
conditions and warning handlers for warning conditions.  It does not
know or care about whether it was called from stop(), warning(),
message(), or some other way.

The most common high-level usage of stop(), warning(), or message() is
to call them with a string and possibly some additional arguments used
to create a message. In these cases a condition object of class
"error" for stop(), "warning" for warning(), and "message" for message
is created implicitly and signaled.

Calling these functions with a condition argument is using lower level
functionality, which gives more power but also means users need to
understand what they are doing. In particular, users who want to call
stop() with a condition argument _and_ want handlers for error
conditions to be used need to make sure that the class of the
condition they signal inherits from "error".

Best,

luke

Thank you, Luke.  I discovered this problem last year, where a user
reported that their use of message(<error>) in futures would not work
the same way as without futures. The issue is that the future
framework captures the error condition and relays it, rather than
outputting the message string, which happens if you don't capture the
error condition. Today there was another similar report from another
package using futures. They both had in common that they use

res <- tryCatch({
  some_fcn(x)
}, error = function(e) {
  message(e)
  NA
})

to return a missing value on errors, while outputting the error
message string to inform the user on the error.  I've been informing
them to instead use

  message(conditionMessage(e))

in this case. Your reply confirms this, and I can now confidently say
that using message(e) is incorrect here.

I think the help pages on message, warning, and stop could be more
explicit on this behavior.

My preference would be that it is an error if calling message(cond)
with !inherits(cond, "message"), calling warning(cond) with
!inherits(cond, "warning"), and stop(cond) with !inherits(cond,
"error").  But, maybe there are valid arguments for allowing such use
cases.

Thanks,

Henrik

Only very few.  None of the current 43 CRAN packages with UBSAN issues 
have them detected by valgrind ... the valgrind overlap is more with 
ASAN issues (see 
https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerComparisonOfMemoryTools).

The UB sanitizer is heavily tied to the compiler.  This has meant that 
new versions of gcc have found more and more issues and (most 
pertinently here) recent versions of clang find about twice as many 
issues as gcc 10/11.

UBSAN in theory runs on quite a range of platforms --- 
https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html#supported-platforms 
-- which unfortunately does not say for which CPUs on those OS.  (Also, 
that is about LLVM clang and not Apple clang as normally used on macOS. 
  And gcc seems only to point to LLVM documentation for supported 
platforms, but its implementation clearly differs.)

Here's an example clarifying the issue:

> strsplit("a:b:c:d", split = ":", fixed = TRUE)
[[1]]
[1] "a" "b" "c" "d"

> strsplit("a:b:c:", split = ":", fixed = TRUE)
[[1]]
[1] "a" "b" "c"

I also ran into this a few times, and I agree that this complicated
things when you need to preserve that last empty element.  Instead of
changing the default behavior, which would probably break lots of
existing code relying on it, one could introduce a new,
backward-compatible argument `drop = TRUE`, e.g.

> strsplit("a:b:c:", split = ":", fixed = TRUE, drop = FALSE)
[[1]]
[1] "a" "b" "c" ""

Alternatively, the man page for the strsplit() could include the following
(or a better phrased version):

"
Note that the trailing empty values will be trimmed (see penultimate
example). A way around this is to use
> read.table(text = paste(strings.to.split, collapse = "\n"), sep = split)
"

Subject: [Rd] Floating Point with POSIXct
Message-ID: <CAFsq6G_cp=6pyh7CEe=rLUK47i+9LqtTyyK5zwjsdcNKnVigVg@mail.gmail.com>

I see in ?POSIXct and I'm trying to understand the note:
> Classes "POSIXct" and "POSIXlt" are able to express fractions of a second. (Conversion of fractions between the two forms may not be exact, but will have better than microsecond accuracy.)

Mainly, I'm trying to understand printing of POSIXct with fractional
seconds.  I see print.POSIXct calls format.POSIXct and eventually
calls format.POSIXlt, which then takes into account `digits.secs` for
printing. The format uses %OS3, which strptime indicates (* added):

> Specific to R is %OSn, which for output gives the seconds *truncated* to 0 <= n <= 6 decimal places (and if %OS is not followed by a digit, it uses the setting of getOption("digits.secs"), or if that is unset, n = 0).

So I'm seeing it truncates the seconds to 3 digits, so I think that is
why the below is printing 0.024.

I think this is especially relevant even if you set
`options(digits.secs = 6)`, then the code in
format.POSIXlt would still return np=3 as the following condition
would break at i = 3

            for (i in seq_len(np) - 1L) if (all(abs(secs - round(secs,
                i)) < 1e-06)) {
                np <- i
                break
            }

as sub_seconds - round(sub_seconds,3) < 1e-06.   This seems to be
expected behavior given the docs, but would any consider this a bug?


Example:

options(digits.secs = 4)
x = structure(947016000.025, class = c("POSIXct", "POSIXt"), tzone = "UTC")
summary(x, digits = 20)
#>                      Min.                   1st Qu.                    Median

#>                      Mean                   3rd Qu.                      Max.
#> "2000-01-04 20:00:00.024" "2000-01-04 20:00:00.024" "2000-01-04 20:00:00.024"
x
#> [1] "2000-01-04 20:00:00.024 UTC"
format.POSIXct(x, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%OS3")
#> [1] "2000-01-04 20:00:00.024"
format.POSIXct(x, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%OS4")
#> [1] "2000-01-04 20:00:00.0249"
sub_seconds = as.numeric(x) %% 1
sub_seconds
#> [1] 0.02499998
round(sub_seconds, 3)
#> [1] 0.025

rounded = as.POSIXct(
  floor(as.numeric(x)) +
    round(as.numeric(x) %% 1, 3),
  origin = "1970-01-01")
rounded
#> [1] "2000-01-04 20:00:00.024 UTC"

I think you've fallen into the R FAQ 7.31 trap :

> ct <- 947016000.025
> ct %% 1
[1] 0.02499998
>

Of course, the issue may still be somewhat interesting, ...

Yes, POSIXct is of limited precision and I think the help page
you mentioned did document that that's one reason for using
POSIXlt instead, as there, sub second accuracy can be much better.

But FAQ 7.31 and the fact that all numbers are base 2 and in
base 2,  no decimal   <n>.025   can be represented in full accuracy.

Also, as you've noticed the R POSIX[cl]t  code just truncates,
i.e. rounds towards 0 unconditionally, and I tend to agree that it
should rather round than truncate.

But we should carefully separate the issues here, from the
underlying inherent FAQ 7.31 truth that most decimal numbers in
a computer are not quite what they look like ...

Martin - I agree that the floating point representation of 0.025 is a
piece of the puzzle, but yes the heart was whether format/%OS3 should
potentially round vs. truncate.  As it's spelled out in ?strptime that
it will truncate, there is no bug per se, but simply unexpected
behavior and I wanted to know if that was the intent in this case.
Best,
John

Another workaround is to append another split symbol (or string) to
the end of the string you're splitting, e.g.

> strsplit(paste0("a:b:c:", split <- ":"), split = split, fixed = TRUE)
[[1]]
[1] "a" "b" "c" ""

If you print the hour and minute at 01:59:59, you get 1 and 59, not 2 
and 0.  That may be the motivation for doing the same for fractional 
seconds.  Should 1:59:59.9 really print as 2:00:00?

That?s a good point. I think that?s fair and why rounding may not be the
appropriate default.  Oddly enough, I think 1:59:60 may be more appropriate
though wrong.  The way the seconds are separated in POSIXlt however, I
don?t think that would ever happen, but the big downside would be if that
would round to 1:59:59.00

I'll look into what effect adding stopifnot(inherits(cond, "error"))
and similar to the others has on CRAN/BIOC packages. Probably won't
get there for a while though.

Subject: [Rd] Outreachy internships
Message-ID: <cb21237e-681c-4ab1-af69-f63994ef386d@www.fastmail.com>

Dear All,

As you will have seen, the R Project is participating in Outreachy this year. Hopefully we can give a friendly welcome when candidates start contributing in mid-March to mid-April and during the internship period (May-August). They will work mainly with their mentors, but depending on the project, may interact with some of the wider community here, as guided by their mentor.

Meanwhile, if anyone is interested in (co-)mentoring an intern or proposing a project, we have till March 23 (https://www.outreachy.org/communities/cfp/the-r-project-for-statistical-computing/). We have some project proposals already in the pipeline, but welcome others to get involved! Summary of ideas here: https://github.com/r-devel/rcontribution/issues/15#issuecomment-1050684123 - note we particularly welcome anyone interested in mentoring a project related to translations. Potentially projects can be cross-posted as large GSoC projects, with maximum one person from Outreachy/GSoC selected in the end.

You can email me to discuss further heather at r-project.org.

Best wishes,
Heather

Subject: [Rd] Proposed diff.character() method
Message-ID: <CANrWemgW5nWHfHi7NJzwe9V2Tj+Y5tWAeK9duCYyNYytDdVYnQ-4636@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R developers,

Recently, I was busy comparing different versions of several packages.
Tired of going back and forth between R and diff, I created a simple
file comparison function in R that I found quite useful. For an
efficient and familiar interface I called it diff.character() and ran
things like:

  diff("old/R/foo.R", "new/R/foo.R")

Before long, I found the need for a directory-wide comparison and
added support for:

  diff("old/R", "new/R")

I have now revisited and fine-polished this function to a point where
I'd like to humbly suggest that diff.character() could be incorporated
into the base package. See attached files and patch based on the
current SVN trunk. It can be tested quickly by sourcing diff.R, or by
building R.

The examples in diff.character.html are somewhat contrived, in the
absence of good example files to compare. You will probably have
better example files to compare from your own work.

Clearly, the functionality differs considerably from the default
diff() method that operates on a single x vector, but in the broad
sense, they're both about showing differences. For most programmers,
calling diff() on two files or directories is already a part of muscle
memory, both intuitive and efficient.

There are a couple of CRAN packages (diffobj, diffR) that can compare
files but not directories. They have package dependencies and return
objects that are more complex (S4, HTML) than the plain list returned
by diff.character().

This basic utility does by no means compete with Meld, Kompare, Emacs
ediff, or other feature-rich diff applications, and using setdiff() as
a basis for file comparison can be a somewhat simplistic approach.
Nevertheless, I think many users may find this a handy tool to quickly
compare scripts and data files. The method could be implemented
differently, with fewer or more features, and I'm happy to amend
according to the R Core Team decision.

In the past, I have proposed additions to core R, some rejected and
others accepted. This proposal fits a useful tool in a currently
vacant diff.character() method at a low cost, using relatively few
lines of base function calls and no compiled code. Its acceptance will
probably depend on whether members of the R Core Team and/or CRAN Team
might see it as a useful addition to their toolkit for interactive and
scripted workflows, including R and CRAN maintenance.

All the best,
Arni

Arni,

I appreciate your idea, but I would argue that you are really writing a new function that has nothing to do with the diff() function in R. diff() computes (variably lagged) differences between elements of a vector, so if you were to even contemplate diff.character, it would certainly have nothing to do with files (since character vectors are not files in the first place).

Therefore I think it's a great idea, but you probably want to start with a function that compares character vectors element by element compare(x, y) and returns something suitable and the write something like file.compare <- function(a, b) compare(readLines(a), readLines(b)). This has nothing to do with the diff() function R, but could be a nice package. Or, you can have a look at diffobj::diffFile().

Cheers,
Simon

This is the relevant part of the NEWS file

CHANGES IN R 4.1.3:

  NEW FEATURES:

    * The default version of Bioconductor has been changed to 3.14.
      (This is used by setRepositories and the menus in GUIs.)

  UTILITIES:

    * R CMD check --as-cran has a workaround for a bug in versions of
      file up to at least 5.41 which mis-identify DBF files last
      changed in 2022 as executables.

  C-LEVEL FACILITIES:

    * The legacy S-compatibility macros SINGLE_* in R_ext/Constants.h
      (included by R.h) are deprecated and will be removed in R 4.2.0.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Initialization of self-starting nls() models with initialization
      functions following the pre-R-4.1.0 API (without the ...
      argument) works again for now, with a deprecation warning.

    * Fixed quoting of ~autodetect~ in Java setting defaults to avoid
      inadvertent user lookup due to leading ~, reported in PR#18231 by
      Harold Gutch.

    * substr(., start, stop) <- v now treats _negative_ stop values
      correctly.  Reported with a patch in PR#18228 by Brodie Gaslam.

    * Subscripting an array x without dimnames by a
      length(dim(x))-column character matrix gave "random" non-sense,
      now an error; reported in PR#18244 by Mikael Jagan.

    * ...names() now matches names(list(...)) closely, fixing PR#18247.

    * all.equal(*, scale = s) now works as intended when length(s) > 1,
      partly thanks to Michael Chirico's PR#18272.

    * print(x) for long vectors x now also works for named atomic
      vectors or lists and prints the correct number when reaching the
      getOption("max.print") limit; partly thanks to a report and
      proposal by Hugh Parsonage to the R-devel list.

    * all.equal(<selfStart>, *) no longer signals a deprecation
      warning.

    * reformulate(*, response=r) gives a helpful error message now when
      length(r) > 1, thanks to Bill Dunlap's PR#18281.

    * Modifying globalCallingHandlers inside withCallingHandlers() now
      works or fails correctly, thanks to Henrik Bengtsson's PR#18257.

    * hist(<Date>, breaks = "days") and hist(<POSIXt>, breaks = "secs")
      no longer fail for inputs of length 1.

    * qbeta(.001, .9, .009) and similar cases now converge correctly
      thanks to Ben Bolker's report in PR#17746.

    * window(x, start, end) no longer wrongly signals "'start' cannot
      be after 'end'", fixing PR#17527 and PR#18291.

    * data() now checks that its (rarely used) list argument is a
      character vector - a couple of packages passed other types and
      gave incorrect results.

    * which() now checks its arr.ind argument is TRUE rather coercing
      to logical and taking the first element - which gave incorrect
      results in package code.

    * model.weights() and model.offset() more carefully extract their
      model components, thanks to Ben Bolker and Tim Taylor's R-devel
      post.

    * list.files(recursive = TRUE) now shows all broken symlinks
      (previously, some of them may have been omitted, PR#18296).

Also for now, I commented on self().template update<update_type::full> at lines 59,90 of glmnetpp/include/glmnetpp_bits/elnet_point/gaussian_base.hpp and glmnet also passed , so example(glmnet) gives the familiar results. Ideally, some better solution is preferable. Jing Hua

Dear jing hua zhao,

You appear to have issues with a particular (pair or single) package; it is
usually better to contact the author / maintainers of the package.  I help a
little with nloptr which had its share of similar issues after its recent as
it (conditionall, if no libnlopr is found) will require cmake, and in a
fairly recentish flavor.  That can pose issues on systems such as yours which
identifies itself per the error message as Scientific Linux 

   linux-scientific7-x86_64/gcc-9/gcc-6.5.0

which is actually dead:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Linux

Stepping back, there is a bit of a disconnect between working on old OS
releases -- sometimes not by choice as your institution, employer, $whoever
... may make you do that -- yet requiring / desiring / attempting to use
bleeding-edge newest versions of R or packages.  That can have friction as
new versions can at times require new tools. The developers try to not
require it, but sometimes it happens, and usually for a reason (as
e.g. nloptr need libnlopt which itself relies on cmake).

So if you can, please considering upgrading to a more current and supported
operating system. For issues specific with a package (as opposed to R and in
particular development on R) the repository may be a better place than this
list.

Cheers,  Dirk

Hi Dirk,

Thank for your help -- as it is our university HPC system I might forward your information. Even a recent branch here uses CentOS8 which appears to have the same fate -- a lot of object/executable files compiled at SL6 do not work on CenOS8 which is really a nuisance. In this case, I have a bit luck since it does work in both ways,

>  library(help=RcppNLoptExample)
> testConstrainedProblem("MMA", TRUE)
Found minimum at f(0.33333,0.2963) = 0.54433105 after 11 function and 22 constraint evaluations.
[1] 0.3333333 0.2962963

Best regards,


JIng Hua

Well that's several topics in one. First off, your institution really needs
to move on from Scientific Linux. Whose main sponsor (Fermi Lab, a few miles
from me here) went to CentOS, which by now is also dead (lovely how that
happens ...) so maybe Rocky Linux it will be. I have simpler tastes and
started using (and then contributing to) Debian as a grad student at a time
(given that it is 2022 now) when you may not have been born yet :grin: ...
Ubuntu LTS is a very good (commercially supported, regularly release in two
year cycles) alternate I use often too.

As for binary incompatibility: that's how it goes. Compilers changes,
libraries change, applications change, ... so you may be prepared to rebuild
when you make such upgrades. Such is life: Many programs give you detailed
notes if you need to or not. E.g. R is pretty good about telling you if you
do or not not need a rebuild. (For R 4.1.0 last April it was little mixed as
I recall: "generally no unless you need updated graphics device" which is
arguably a more refined case. For R 4.2.0 I think we're good too but I will
be sure to check next month. No changes for R 4.1.3 _today_ as it is just a
patch release.)

Glad you found working versions, and my NLopt example driver. Also, I
sometimes recommend going back to older releases which may cover your use
cases without giving headaches due to new(est) tools.

In any event, let's move this away from r-devel. Maybe come to the
r-package-devel list which is more specifically on building (and using)
packages.

Cheers, Dirk

Subject: [Rd] security holes in system2
Message-ID: <20220310162226.3szcltsazvjywws3@localhost>

Dear R Developers,

The documentation for "system2" only defines "args" as

     args: a character vector of arguments to 'command'.

This encourages the reader to think that R's system2 interface is passing its arguments unchanged to exec().

But I was surprised to find that under the hood, you're just pasting my arguments together and sending them to a subshell to be re-parsed:

     command <- paste(c(env, shQuote(command), args), collapse = " ")

What horror! Please fix or document the fact that system2 executes its ARGUMENTS and not just the command.

Aside from being relevant to data scientists, it's a big security hole. It means that, in some cases, something that looks like plain text in my R code will end up being executed as a command on my system, which seems dangerous to me.

     > my_data=c("<(>&2 echo oops)")
     > system2("echo",args=my_data)
     /dev/fd/63
     oops

Thank you,

Frederick

Subject: [Rd] Bundling MathJax
Message-ID: <20220313154736.7301b31f@Tarkus>

Hello R-devel,

I appreciate the efforts devoted towards improving equation typography
in HTML manuals. Since MathML lost its status as the way to express
mathematics on the web after its removal from Google Chrome in 2013,
MathJax and KaTeX are probably the best options left: both TtH [1] and
HeVeA [2] don't render math quite as well and likely don't do anything
about accessibility of the resulting equations (which seems to be the
reason to focus on the HTML documentation in the first place).

Having seen r81881 [3], I would like to suggest bundling MathJax
together with R instead of loading it from the Internet. Every now and
then, I work from places with spotty Internet connection (e.g. mobile
network on a train). If R defaults to downloading a file every time
Rd2HTML is called, that would be very inconvenient to me, especially
since the requests for external JavaScript could intermittently fail
or take a long time to load, resulting in partially failed renders.

For now, R documentation can be viewed without access to external
resources (admittedly, not counting the use of external \figure{} and
other Rd macros by packages, which is rare). I think that's a major
strength of R and I would like to help preserve it.

Ivan

An issue related to this was faced by the mathjaxr package:  The file 
used for display is usually a minified version of the MathJax source, 
and Debian didn't consider it close enough to source code to want to 
distribute it as FOSS.  So if the minified file is included with R, the 
original source should also be included.

An alternative to this would be to provide a utility to download the 
minified file.  Users with poor connectivity could do that once and 
access the local copy thereafter.

An alternative, more robust method is to render the math-to-html in R
using the katex R package. This way no JavaScript library needs to be
included in the html manual pages, merely a small katex css file with
some styling, which is much lighter and safer to load in manual pages
(and probably more feasible to bundle with R).

For an example, see: https://docs.ropensci.org/katex/reference/math_to_rd.html

Usually browser caching should avoid multiple downloads, shouldn't it?

Bundling is something we considered (and is still a possibility), but
ended up not doing mainly because it's more than just a single file.
E.g., these are the files bundled by mathjaxr:

https://github.com/wviechtb/mathjaxr/tree/master/src/mathjax/es5

Would it be reasonable to use the installation provided by mathjaxr
instead, if it is available?

Would this really work? Wouldn't you also need the supplementary files
such as fonts (relative to the main js file)?

Sorry, my memory was bad.  It wasn't just one minified file, it was 
multiple minified files.  You can see what was included before the 
Debian complaint here:

 
https://github.com/wviechtb/mathjaxr/tree/81201dc1d5851928b208f2575d6d992229bd9eaf

Your suggestion of optionally using an installed copy of the mathjaxr 
package seems ideal.

If this is affecting you now and you need a solution then the `sys` package
has `exec_wait`:

The hacker tries and succeeds in running `rm` with `system2`:

 > system2("echo", args="hello world ; rm /etc/systemfile")
hello world
rm: cannot remove '/etc/systemfile': No such file or directory

because the semicolon starts a new command, but fails with `sys::exec_wait`:

> sys::exec_wait("echo", args="hello world ; rm /etc/systemfile")
hello world ; rm /etc/systemfile

where it echoes all the args.

For simple applications it should be a drop-in replacement.

I think that any code that uses system() (or system2() or shell()) has a
big security hole.

It seems transform can modify column names and accepts data.frame

Message-ID: <CH0PR20MB3947355A6D7C27DCEA55CC8BBE0F9@CH0PR20MB3947.namprd20.prod.outlook.com>

Hello R developers,

I have noticed that the footer for the R's manpage nicely reports the version and date:

R 4.0.0                                                                  September 2020                                                                     R(1)

Whereas that of Rscript does not include version, and is incorrect as per date:
	
R scripting                                                                April 2007                                                                 Rscript(1)

It could profitably read:

Rscript 4.0.0                                                                September 2020                                                    Rscript(1)

I do like the build-time rendering approach (I had started writing a
plotmath-style equation renderer for documentation in my R packages
with HTML and TeX support, but quickly abandoned it), but I see two
problems with adopting KaTeX in tools::Rd2HTML:

1. As far as I understand, these changes are supposed to improve
accessibility of the documentation. (PDF is beautifully typeset, but
can't be understood by screen readers as well as web pages.) MathJax
seems to have better accessibility than KaTeX. While there is a hidden
MathML block for screen readers in KaTeX output, some of them don't
pick it up: https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/issues/820

2. If R-core were to adopt KaTeX, that would add a hard dependency from
Rd2HTML to the V8 JavaScript engine. I think that's unlikely to happen.

</seriously> Maybe in 20 years, when browser is the operating system
and everyone runs R compiled to JavaScript with emscripten...

True, but there's also the issue of download.file() called from Rd2HTML
spending time (or timing out) on round-trips to the server. The
cacheOK= option only controls the server-side caching, as far as my
understanding of src/modules/internet/libcurl.c goes, so the file is
always downloaded from the CDN.

If that's the way you would like to go, the TOCTOU problem can be
avoided by sending the HTML page to the client with plain text math
visible and LaTeX math invisible, a script performing
createElement()/appendChild() to actually download MathJax, and handling
the "load" event of the newly created <script> element to replace the
plain text math with its LaTeX rendering, when (if) the script actually
loads.

That's very reasonable. If this becomes a function used by Rd2HTML by
default, it could be a good idea to give Priority: recommended to
mathjax to ensure that most users don't have to hit the network when
browsing documentation. Although this may be harder to combine with my
previous idea; too many moving parts.

Pardon my ignorance, but how much does it matter whether the file is
minified when the documentation is served over a local network? Does
JavaScript minification speed up parsing or involve other
transformations without which it would be hard or impossible to run the
code in the browser?

You should check the corresponding pages in the current version and the developer versio. It rather unlikely that there will any attempt to correct an out of date version.

Hi Ivan,

I would say the biggest impact is in terms of the size of the installed package (~4MB versus ~2.9MB). Of course, these days this is a trivial difference in terms of storage. The decrease in load and execution time is probably negligible (esp. when MathJax is served locally), but I haven't done any proper benchmarks on this.

Note that mathjaxr only minifies when the (suggested) 'js' package is installed, so this step is completely optional.

Best,
Wolfgang

Hello everyone,

glad to see the progress on this! It would be a major advancement in the
user experience of using our beloved _statistical_ language and
environment. I have brought the topic a year ago or so here and Simon
Urbanek offered a "hack" which I have implemented in the package many use
today (https://github.com/netique/documath). However, it is a customized
Rd2HTML injection, which is generally a really bad idea... (OT: check out
the {mvbutils} package, which I think does a bunch of "illegal" things,
such as rewriting base functions on the fly.)

As far as I know, I would certainly vote for KaTeX, as it is _perceivably_
faster and, as many of you mentioned, is capable of server-side rendering
which I deem promising.

Keep up the good work!

Best,
Jan

I think the bug is not only that it passes check.names and other data
frame arguments
but also that it changes names.

Either it should allow check.names but default it to FALSE or else not
pass it and
not change the names.

Subject: [Rd] stage=install in \doi definition could lead to problems
Message-ID: <20220315233828.196154bd@Tarkus>

Good Sys.time() everyone,

If this is not the right place for such questions, please let me know.

I was wondering why \doi has been changed to stage=install instead of
stage=build in r81891 [1]. I think it might lead to problems, but in
the spirit of Chesterton's fence, I'd like to learn the reasons. Is it
to make R CMD build more performant, avoiding the need for the
"installing the package to process man pages" step for the common case
of the \doi macro?

Some DOIs look a bit scary. One example that comes to mind is as
follows:

10.1002/(SICI)1099-128X(199801/02)12:1<55::AID-CEM501>3.0.CO;2-#

Until the recent fix in r81817 [2], it used to require special
treatment in order to display correctly in a man page, but now it just
works if I copy and paste it into \doi{}. With the macro definition
using [stage=build], I could build a package with a recent build of
R-devel, get the correct \doi expansion inlined, install the package on
an older version of R, and it would still work, thanks to R keeping the
parse tree in build/partial.rdb.

With the macro defined using [stage=install], any version of R older
than 2022-02-25 (r81817), which doesn't have this fix, would fail to
link to the DOI correctly, not having the correct expansion of \doi
to rely upon any more:

Rd2HTML(parse_Rd(textConnection('\\name{foo}\n\\title{bar}\\description{\\doi{10.1002/(SICI)1099-128X(199801/02)12:1<55::AID-CEM501>3.0.CO;2-#}}'),
fragment = FALSE), stages = c('build'))

<a
href="http://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1099-128X(199801/02)12:1%3C55::AID-CEM501%3E3.0.CO;2-#">doi:
10.1002/(SICI)1099-128X(199801/02)12:1&lt;55::AID-CEM501&gt;3.0.CO;2-#</a>

(The hash sign doesn't get URL-encoded, and the link gets broken.)

Sorry for giving you yet another case of <https://xkcd.com/1172/>. If I
have to, I might be able to "unroll" the macro myself for the few cases
where it matters.

Ivan

Thank you for your feedback! I think this is the right place (but note 
that such very recent changes *could* still be work in progress and may 
sometimes need a bit more time to be worth discussing here).

Yes, that certainly is one of the advantages of the change, affecting 
more than 1000 packages on CRAN that currently ship a partial Rd db just 
because they use the \doi macro. Besides considerably speeding up R CMD 
build for these packages, the change also slightly reduces the size of 
the tarballs.

I think the most probable reason for the previous use of stage=build for 
that Sexpr was to avoid shipping the PDF package manual with the 
package, as generally triggered by install or render time Sexprs. This 
has now been addressed.

Thank you for the example. I think there is another solution: you could 
set \RdOpts{stage=build} before the Rd section containing that "scary" 
\doi (and if needed revert to \RdOpts{stage=install} afterwards). Then 
the corresponding Sexpr would get evaluated during the build stage as 
before and the correctly escaped hyperlink from building with 
R-devel/4.2.0 would be available also in older R versions.

Thanks for the solution! I didn't realise that \RdOpts could be used
here. I can confirm that it works for me.

Subject: [Rd] Using cairo on arm64 macOS
Message-ID: <CA+6hu7d6zeghOXhGQETwWaXH4ryVJ7wXjy5LXORTqArQHjEDGg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

first, let me appreciate the efforts around "Apple Silicone" builds of R,
works like a charm! However, I have found recently that this build does not
have cairo in capabilities() and in turn I cannot use cairo_pdf device.
Intel build has cairo readily available, but M1 does not. I have done
various attempts on installing cairo using brew or
install.package("Cairo"); maybe the most preferable way is to follow
https://mac.r-project.org/bin/, but that also failed stating "architecture
aarch64 is not supported on os darwin20, only available architectures:
x86_64arm64". I have also tried downloading cairo from
https://mac.r-project.org/bin/darwin20/arm64/ and copying it into
opt/R/arm64, but with no success... Nor current devel R worked for me in
that issue.

I think that I overlooked something, maybe around installing cairo to
opts/R/arm64 (is it really mere copying?). In that case I would edit the
docs and websites around the Apple Silicone build to better clarify what
needs to be done, but I may be that cairo is just not yet supported.

Anyway many thank for looking into this!

Best,
Jan

This question probably belongs in R-Sig-Mac rather than here.  If you

Just a status update:

Thanks to Jeroen and others for pointing out KaTeX, which I had not
used before but indeed seems preferable in many respects. I don't
think build-time rendering is a feasible choice given the dependency
implications, but I have now added KaTeX as another (and the default)
alternative for client-side rendering.

Currently, KaTeX is served from a CDN. The plan is to ship a copy of
KaTeX with R by the time R 4.2.0 is released, but we have not yet
decided on the best way to do that.

If you want MathJax, set

Sys.setenv("_R_HELP_ENABLE_ENHANCED_HTML_" = TRUE)
options(help.htmlmath = "mathjax")

This will use the local copy from mathjaxr if it is installed, and a
CDN otherwise.

Best,

Regarding check.names, note that transform isn't alone in this misbehaviour. If you refer to the last few points of section 4.5.6 (titled 'Silence') in my article linked below, you'll see that subset appears to do the same. My guess is that all of the functions like with, transform, within, and subset will likely share these properties. For a quick example, compare the 'foo' columns of cbind(mtcars, foo = 3, foo = 4, foo = 5) to that of subset(cbind(mtcars, foo = 3, foo = 4, foo = 5), select = -carb). It looks like check.names has modified the column names in the subset case only.

Hi everyone,

It seems that `sd` and `var` are currently not implemented as generic
functions. I was wondering if it is possible to request that they be
implemented, or if there is a proper process to go through doing that?

Apologies if this has already been discussed!

Thanks. Should be fixed now (r81946).

The latter seems logical since with older R's \doi is expanded and therefore contains the expanded URL about which R-devel complains. The warnings do seem somewhat unpredictable in that I tried different examples and sometimes got warnings sometimes didn't.

Subject: [Rd] Include line number in the error messages regarding misuse of
 placeholder
Message-ID: <OSZP286MB2305B5382F66E1D11FF4BBA6D5169@OSZP286MB2305.JPNP286.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Hello, R maintainers,

We are discussing the changes needed for code linting in the lintr package development for the upcoming placeholder in a pipe at <https://github.com/r-lib/lintr/issues/959>.

First, thanks for implementing the feature!

While I'm playing with it and see what we could do to improve in code linting for it, I notice that the error messages produced by the parser regarding the misuse of placeholder do not contain anything about the line number, which makes it hard to tell user which line of code causes this error.

For example,

    parse(text = "data |> fun(mpg ~ cyl, data1 = _, data2 = _)")

produces the error "pipe placeholder may only appear once"

    parse(text = "mtcars |> lm(mpg ~ cyl, data = fun(_))")

produces the error "invalid use of pipe placeholder".

Neither contains a line number. Michael Chirico tried to include the correct line number (https://github.com/r-lib/lintr/issues/959#issuecomment-1073389513), but it seems non-trivial to do so.

We are wondering if it is possible to include a proper line number in these error messages, like some other messages that include it, so that user could know better about where the error occurs?

Best regards,
Kun Ren

Subject: [Rd] model.matrix and subset
Message-ID: <f03410$hkgtmc@ironport10.mayo.edu>

I've found the following unexpected behaviour from the model.matrix function, namely that 
the "subset" argument carries forward when I would not expect it to.
Here is an example using lm:

--------------------

# Data set modified from the lm help file
test <- data.frame(weight= c(4.17,5.58,5.18,6.11,4.50,4.61,5.17,4.53,5.33,5.14,
4.81,4.17,4.41,3.59,5.87,3.83,6.03,4.89,4.32,4.69),
 ?????????????????? group = gl(2, 10, 20, labels = c("Ctl","Trt")),
 ?????????????????? zed = rep (1:2, 10))

fit <- lm( weight ~ group, test, subset= (zed==1))

data2 <- data.frame( weight= 1:6,? group= rep(c("Ctl", "Trt"), 3))
model.matrix (fit, data=data2)

 ?Error in eval(substitute(subset), data, env) : object 'zed' not found
--------------------

This arises out a user's bug report for survival::concordance; which has methods for 
formula, lm, glm, and coxph.? I have been using? model.frame and model.matrix to create 
the new response and linear predictor when a 'newdata' argument is used.??? The above 
issue makes it fail for all of lm, glm, and coxph when the initial model includes a subset.

I think that the user is correct:? if someone asks for model.matrix(fit, data=new) they 
almost certainly want the model matrix for exactly that data.? But it leaves me in a bit 
of a quandry.?? I don't want to write private model.matrix methods for glm and lm, and if 
I fix the coxph methods then they will disagree with the standard ones.

Thoughts?

Hmm...

AFAICT, predict.lm does effectively this:

Terms <- delete.response(terms(fit))
m <- model.frame(Terms, data2)
model.matrix(Terms, m)

except for some embellishments that I can't quite grasp at this point.

I expect that this is to circumvent similar issues.

Yes, the predict functions do not use model.frame(fit), rather they extract the terms, as 
you say.?? I do the same in predict.coxph.

One way to address my question would be for the documentation of model.frame and 
model.matrix to explicitly state what they currently do when data= is specified, i.e., 
that any subset or na.action clauses in the original call will be applied to the new data 
as well.? It still won't be what a user might expect, but it might keep future users out 
of danger.

Of course, when there is no data= clause, a user will expect the original data set; which 
impllies retaining any subset= arguments in that instance.

Subject: [Rd] `slot<-` performs an in-place modification
Message-ID: <7cb8e198-ec3f-6ea9-76d9-172816b1ab59@gmail.com>

Hi,

I just found out that `slot<-` performs an in-place modification of the 
object:

 ? setClass("A", slots=c(stuff="ANY"))
 ? x <- new("A", stuff=11:14)
 ? y <- `slot<-`(x, "stuff", value=99)

Then:

 ? y
 ? # An object of class "A"
 ? # Slot "stuff":
 ? # [1] 99

 ? x
 ? # An object of class "A"
 ? # Slot "stuff":
 ? # [1] 99

That doesn't seem right!

Is this violation of the standard pass-by-value semantic somehow 
intended here because most of the time people are expected to do 
'slot(x, "stuff") <- 99' instead, in which case the violation cannot be 
observed so does not matter? I didn't find anything in the man page 
about this.

I see this behavior with R 4.1.3 and current R devel.

Thanks,

H.

Message-ID: <CAL6gwn+jArSEzg6Ha71v9vigsZCcZmOymiChrpfn-Bs--QGG8A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello.

In the current notes for R-devel [1] referring to LAPACK, it states

>The included LAPACK sources have been updated to version 3.10.0, except for the four Fortran
>77 routines which 3.10.0 has re-implemented in Fortran 90 (where the older versions have been

I am a bit confused as I know R supports F9x [2]. Moreover, an F90
compiler seems to be the minimum requirement for R [3]. May I ask for
clarification of this note, please?

Thank you,

Avi

Subject: [Rd] running examples with enhanced help engine also requires mime
 package
Message-ID: <CAJXgQP1JPcD+PqQOo=x3Sp9_TZkh44LqP1PLEYae+fqMQrppAA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

The new enhanced help system is fantastic! I've been playing around
with the enhanced help system introduced recently in R 4.2.0, and I
noticed one minor issue. When attempting to run examples from within a
Help page (in HTML help), if the knitr package is not installed, one
sees:

    To view output in the browser, the knitr package must be installed.

I think this is expected. However, after installing the 'knitr'
package and attempting to run examples again, I see:

    Error in loadNamespace(x) : there is no package called 'mime'

as it looks like 'knitr' (or a dependency?) is trying to use 'mime'
behind the scenes in the Help server. Because 'mime' is not an
explicit dependency of 'knitr', running install.packages("knitr")
isn't sufficient to ensure 'mime' is also installed (which a user
might have expected).

I'm not sure if this should be resolved in 'knitr' (e.g. via just
depending on the 'mime' package) or if this should be tweaked in R
itself.

Thanks,
Kevin

This works but R-devel CMD check then gives the warning that "Found the following URL's which should use doi ...".
For a reprex, see the package at https://github.com/GeoBosh/reprexes/tree/master/redundantDots (man/fun_3.Rd contains the \doi's).
Building that package with R-devel throws one warning, building it with non-R-devel throws two (my R-devel is from yesterday, r81914). The latter seems logical since with older R's \doi is expanded and therefore contains the expanded URL about which R-devel complains. The warnings do seem somewhat unpredictable in that I tried different examples and sometimes got warnings sometimes didn't.  

I may be missing something but would it be reasonable not to apply this check to packages submitted to CRAN until this is made stable?

Thank you for your feedback! I think this is the right place (but note 
that such very recent changes *could* still be work in progress and may 
sometimes need a bit more time to be worth discussing here).

Yes, that certainly is one of the advantages of the change, affecting 
more than 1000 packages on CRAN that currently ship a partial Rd db just 
because they use the \doi macro. Besides considerably speeding up R CMD 
build for these packages, the change also slightly reduces the size of 
the tarballs.

I think the most probable reason for the previous use of stage=build for 
that Sexpr was to avoid shipping the PDF package manual with the 
package, as generally triggered by install or render time Sexprs. This 
has now been addressed.

Thank you for the example. I think there is another solution: you could 
set \RdOpts{stage=build} before the Rd section containing that "scary" 
\doi (and if needed revert to \RdOpts{stage=install} afterwards). Then 
the corresponding Sexpr would get evaluated during the build stage as 
before and the correctly escaped hyperlink from building with 
R-devel/4.2.0 would be available also in older R versions.

Thanks for the solution! I didn't realise that \RdOpts could be used
here. I can confirm that it works for me.

Thanks for the report and diagnosis.

I guess the R-level workaround would be to write a replacement for
knitr::image_uri(). That would probably have been fine if we forced
png to be the only output format, but I see no reason to restrict to
specific formats, so the flexibility is useful.

So I'll just add mime to the message.

Best,

You are seriously confused.  Reference [2] is about package 
installation, not building R.  As R CMD INSTALL is almost entirely 
written in R, it is necessarily not usable in the early stages of 
building R such as compiling in src/modules/lapack.

We could have added support for .f90 files and Fortran modules to the R 
build, but not in time for R 4.2.0.  The NEWS for R-devel (you linked to 
that for 4.2.0alpha) has further information on future plans.

There are reports of bugs in two of the new LAPACK routines, another 
reason not to use them in R 4.2.0.

the 'domain' for the translation, a character string, or NULL to flush the cache; see 'Details'.

Describing domain = NULL as "to flush the cache" is partly wrong because it applies only to function 'bindtextdomain'. It doesn't apply to functions 'gettext' and 'ngettext' that are also documented by gettext.Rd and also have 'domain' argument. In 'gettext' or 'ngettext', domain = NULL is the default and means that domain is inferred.

Subject: [Rd] Backslashes, braces, \Sexpr and user macros
Message-ID: <20220325183223.3ab20393-2358@arachnoid>


Hello R-devel,

I had been using an Rd trick that runs afoul of the changes in
r81965[*]. After the change, there seems to be a problem with any
user-defined macro that takes R code, forwards it to \Sexpr and gets
passed a string literal containing '{':

\newcommand{\RRd}{\Sexpr[stage=build,results=rd]{#1}}
\RRd{x <- 'a string with { inside it'; 'okay'}

R-4.1.3: okay
R-devel: Error: x.Rd: '\{' is an unrecognized escape in character string
starting "'a string with \{"
Execution halted

My actual use case is a macro that forwards its argument to
\Sexpr{tools::toRd(bibentry(...))}. I've been trying to pass \enc{}{}
as an argument to bibentry; previously, I had to use a workaround to
create the backslash, but now any braces (in addition to backslashes)
inside string literals also result in errors:

\newcommand{\bib}{\Sexpr[stage=build,results=rd]{bibentry(#1)}}
\bib{'Misc',
  author = person('J.', 'Doe'), year = 2022,
  title = paste0(
    'A ', rawToChar(as.raw(0x5c)),
    'enc{m??se}{moose} bit my sister once'
#       ^-----^^-----^--- in these four places
  )
}

R-4.1.3: Doe J (2022). ?A m??se bit my sister once.?

R-devel: Error: x.Rd: '\{' is an unrecognized escape in character string
starting "'enc\{"
Execution halted

Should I have relied upon \Sexpr{#1} working inside user-defined
macros? Georgi N. Boshnakov's Rdpack does similar things (and has been
an inspiration for my tricks). I'll be glad to re-write some of my Rd
to achieve the same result using less crazy tricks, assuming there is a
right way to do that.

Glad to be inspiration:).  There are no tricks in Rdpack and
using \Sexpr{#1} in user Rd macros is ok but care is needed. In your example:

\newcommand{\bib}{\Sexpr[stage=build,results=rd]{bibentry(#1)}}
\bib{'Misc',
  author = person('J.', 'Doe'), year = 2022,
  title = paste0(
    'A ', rawToChar(as.raw(0x5c)),
    'enc{m??se}{moose} bit my sister once'
#       ^-----^^-----^--- in these four places
  )
}

I am surprised that the above macro ever worked as intended. 'bibentry' returns a 'bibentry' object and \Sexpr converts it with 'as.character'. There is no as.character method for bibentry, so the result would be something like list(list(given = "J.", family = ...)). That is what I get on Ubuntu with R-devel (r82022 2022-03-29) and non-R-devel. I put the above in a package. If you are running a command on the console the bibentry object will be printed ok since the default print method for bibentry uses the text style. In fact, if the body of your macro is replaced by

capture.output(print(bibentry))

I get the desired result in the built documentation:

Doe J (2022). ?A m??se bit my sister once.?

One thing to be aware of is that the argument of \Sexpr is R-like but that of user defined macros is not. When the parser escapes the argument to your macro, it doesn't know that in your case it is R code (in the invocation of '\bib' above), since it would need to 'understand' the body of your macro and notice that you are using #1 in R code, not in LaTeX-like text. This would explain the error message you get. 

I don't know if something was fixed between the R-devel you used and probably the most recent one I did but reproducible example and system information would be helpful. I have some simple packages used in bug reports at https://github.com/GeoBosh/reprexes

I'm sorry, somehow I didn't pay enough attention when preparing that
part of the e-mail. The actual macro uses tools::toRd(bibentry(...)).

I'll remember to provide more reproducible examples next time.

c81965 was reverted, and "take two" of the improvement in c82029
doesn't crash my macros (thanks, Kurt Hornik!), but I'm still willing
to rewrite my macros to give R maintainers more freedom to evolve Rd in
the future. Maybe it's better to use a per-package database of
bibentries and reference them with much simpler macro arguments, but
that would be better fit for R-pkg-devel :)

The problem here is the Rd format, and the way user macros are handled.

The Rd format is unreasonably complicated, with several different modes 
of parsing (LaTeX-like, R-like and verbatim), and context dependent 
rules on what needs escaping.

The user macros, on the other hand, are very simple.  After expanding a 
macro, the parser just pushes the characters onto the input stream. 
This makes it pretty much impossible for automatic escaping to work, 
since the context can change in the middle of the new characters, but 
they haven't been parsed yet.

The motivation for r81965 was that some DOIs contain characters that 
need escaping in the context where the  \doi{} macro is being used. 
Kurt and I attempted to fix this automatically, rather than burdening 
the user with doing the escaping by hand.  That's hard for users to do, 
and if they get it wrong, the parser is likely to get confused and not 
give a helpful error message.

Unfortunately, our first attempt was a little too eager, and it caused 
the problems some of you saw.

It might be possible to do things differently, but really the only real 
solution would be to change the help file markup definition to something 
a little less insane.  When I wrote the Rd parser I was partly hoping 
that it would eventually be used to convert legacy help pages to a 
better format.  Roxygen allowing the use of Markdown instead of Rd 
markup is a step in the right direction, but (as I've said before) I 
believe forcing help text to be embedded in code is harmful to the goal 
of writing good documentation.  It addresses a real problem (writing .Rd 
documentation is hard), but I think it creates new problems, making both 
the code and the documentation harder to read and to edit than if they 
were separate.
