Some of these involve casting an int to Rboolean. Best case, the int is
compared against NA_LOGICAL beforehand, avoiding any mistake (there's
at least one like that). Worst case, NA_LOGICAL is not considered before
the cast, so NA will now be interpreted as TRUE. This is hard to check
without actually reading the code.

Some packages compare an Rboolean expression against NA_LOGICAL [1].
This implies having stored an int in an Rboolean value as in the
previous paragraph. I think that it wasn't disallowed according to the
C standard to store NA_LOGICAL in an enumeration type wide enough to
fit it (and it evidently worked in practice). With typedef bool
Rboolean, storing NA_LOGICAL in an Rboolean converts it to 'true', so
the comparison will definitely fail:

DPQ src/pnchisq-it.c:530,532
Rmpfr src/convert.c:535
checkmate src/helper.c:102
chron src/unpaste.c:21
collapse src/data.table_rbindlist.c:208,258,383,384,408,431
data.table (many; fixed in Git)
ff src/ordermerge.c:5074 (one declaration, many comparisons)
networkDynamic src/Rinit.c:209 src/is.active.c:75,76,96-98
slam src/util.c:258
this.path src/get_file_from_closure.h:13,43 src/thispath.c:14,17,19,39
 src/ext.c:25 src/setsyspath.c:8 src/get_file_from_closure.h:13,43

Four packages cast int* pointers returned by LOGICAL() to Rboolean* or
use sizeof(Rboolean) to calculate buffer sizes in calls to memcpy()
with LOGICAL() buffers [2]. With typedef bool Rboolean, this is a
serious mistake, because the memory layout of the types is no longer
compatible:

bit64 src/integer64.c:576,603,914,929,942,955,968,981,994
collapse src/data.table_rbindlist.c:19,67,105
data.table (many; fixed in Git)
kit src/utils.c:390

I don't know Coccinelle that well and there may be additional cases I
failed to consider. At which point is it appropriate to start notifying
maintainers of the bugs not caught by their test suites?

The good news is that without a C23-enabled compiler, the problem will
only happen to source files that #include <stdbool.h>. The bad news is
that such a source file will technically disagree with the rest of R
about the type of Rboolean, including the prototypes of the API
functions that accept Rboolean:

#include <stdbool.h>
#include <Rinternals.h>
typedef void (*pordervector1)(int *, int, SEXP, Rboolean, Rboolean);
// ...
pordervector1 f = R_orderVector1;
f(pindx, length(indx), arg, nalast, decreasing);

foo.c:27:17: runtime error: call to function R_orderVector1 through

*, bool, bool)'

With sanitizers disabled, this doesn't seem to cause any real problems
thanks to the calling convention, where both 'enum's and 'bool's are
passed and returned in a register.

This is work in progress, and it was not intended to apply to R-devel 
unless configured with --with-C23 or using a compiler (such as GCC 
pre-15) that defaults to C23.  We will back that out pending further 
testing.

Tomas,

I am thinking of writing something for R-devel, and hope to have your 
input first.

I get moderated on R-devel as I am now subscribed as 
brian.ripley at R-project.org which of course I cannot send from. So I am 
even more discouraged from posting there.  (R-core is bad enough with 
Luke discouraging all innovation except by him and Simon completely 
misunderstanding the C23 status.)

Thanks,

Brian

----------------

There are several of these, and few guarantees for inter-working.

a) R's logical vectors, which include a value NA for its elements.
b) R's Rboolean type in C/C++

c) C++'s bool type
d) C23's bool type
e) C99's _Bool type to which bool is aliased if <stdbool.h> is included.
f) Fortran's LOGICAL type

a) is currently implemented as a C int (so 32-bit) type with NA as the C 
value NA_LOGICAL which is the same a NA_INTEGER.

b) is currently implemented as a C enum with two values.  I don't know 
of any guarantees on how that is stored except in char or an integer 
type -- however it seems common practice to use a 32-bit type (int or 
unsigned int would not be distinguishable).  (C23 ?6.7.3.3)  Enums can 
have a specified data type, but we do not.

C23 states that bool has 1 value bit and some padding bits (?6.2.6.2) so 
it can be stored in char-sized storage (i.e. bytes) or multiples 
thereof.  And that _Bool is a alternative name for bool.

f) is complier-dependent: for interoperability with C or R, code should 
use c_bool from iso_c_binding (Fortran 2003).  Fortran compilers store 
LOGICAL in compiler-dependent ways, and for a long time we got away with 
assuming that was equivalent to int (so LOGICAL values could be passed 
to and from with int* on the C/R side).  But sometime around GCC 8 they 
changed to int_least32_t, which on common platforms is the same as int 
but does not need to be.

It seems that in all cases coercion to an integer type coerces false 
values to 0 and true values to 1 (and this is guaranteed by C23 at 
least).  And C23 guarantees that when coercing from an integer type to 
bool zero values are coerced to false and non-zero ones to true (bool is 
'an unsigned integer type').  However, that does not seem to be true for 
C++ as UB sanitizers warn on coercing values other than 0/1.

I believe it to be the intention that c), d) and e) have the same 
representation and interwork using the same compiler, but I could not 
find that documented and see signs that e) might differ in C17 and C23 
modes.

----------------

I need to look again at the C and C++ standards which with my vision I 
need to do in very small chunks.  Oh for the vision I once had!

Yes, thanks, if you have the energy, I think it would be great if you 
could contact the maintainers directly if you find obvious problems in 
their packages, as much as in any open-source project. Casting int* from 
LOGICAL() to Rboolean* falls into that category.

Any bug finding tool would only find a subset of the bugs, that's ok - 
helping to fix only some packages (and not all) is still a big help.

 ?Probably worth an extra sentence making this more explicit. I've added

In today's CRAN snapshot, there turned out to be 198 packages that use
4.1 syntax in examples but not in code, 5 packages that use 4.2 syntax
in examples but 4.1 in the code, and 3 packages that use 4.2 syntax in
examples but not the code. This may be slightly imprecise because I
don't have some of the Rd macro packages installed and run
Rd2ex(stages=NULL) on manually-parsed Rd files without installing the
packages.

Attaching a patch that checks the syntax used in Rd examples at the
same time as the main R code, not necessarily the best way to perform
this check. Is it perhaps worth separating R/* checks from man/*.Rd
checks? Should R CMD check try to reuse the Rd database from the
installed copy of the package?

R Core,

Here is another minor typo which I had spotted three days ago and sent to
Brian, but have not heard back nor seen it incorporated. Doubly trivial as in
a comment but a dual typo nevertheless. Would be nice if someone could fold
this in. I still have the same diff here for the current r87707.

Cheers, Dirk

L.S.

AFAICS the Writing R Extensions and R Installation and Administration manuals do not explicitly discuss binary R packages on GNU/Linux. Only installation from source is mentioned (https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-admin.html#Installing-packages-1)
and when discussing repository layouts (https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-admin.html#Setting-up-a-package-repository) no mention is made of conventions for GNU/Linux distributions.

The proprietary Package Manager (PPM) from Posit (https://packagemanager.posit.co/client/#/) does offer binary packages for GNU/Linux, but the usage of this service is restricted in ways that go against the principles of open source (https://posit.co/about/posit-service-terms-of-use/). By way of example, mirroring is not allowed and certain categories of users are excluded (age categories, competitors, ...). This is maybe expected to some, but this clearly does not offer a proper foundation for the distribution of open source R packages.

For this reason I am wondering whether the R project / CRAN would not be better placed and/or open to support distribution of binary R packages on GNU/Linux.

A second, orthogonal question is whether the R project can advance an official convention for the repository layout related to the distribution of binary GNU/Linux packages. Our proposal would be to use something along

http://mydomain.com/bin/linux/jammy/x86_64/contrib/4.4

which IMHO is more elegant than

http://mydomain.com/bin/linux/jammy-x86_64/contrib/4.4

(and which mimicks the documented MacOS convention

http://mydomain.com/bin/macosx/big-sur-x86_64/contrib/4.4).

Anyone?

Obviously willing to work out details and collaborate on the topic.

Kind regards,
Tobias

Tobias,

although we did discuss the possibility of extending the os/toolchain/architecture notation for binary packages beyond macOS, Linux was not necessarily on the list as Linux distributions have already established ways of providing binaries, so it does not seem productive to duplicate the effort. Can you elaborate a bit more on what you had in mind? Binaries are by design specific to toolchain, distribution and architecture, so there is no such thing as a "GNU/Linux binary". The only reliable way to distribute packages in Linux is from sources or by the Linux distribution repositories. Binaries are inherently tied to system dependencies and their versions, so such concept doesn't make any sense outside of the distribution. There is no such thing as a "jammy binary" to take up your example - it would have to depend on the distribution, toolchain and all library versions as well.

Cheers,
Simon

We agree. It is just used as a generic term here to denote a package built for a specific version of a distribution for a specific architecture and its toolchain.

jammy is a specific version of the distribution (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS) and the architecture is included in my proposal (x86_64)

http://mydomain.com/bin/linux/jammy/x86_64/contrib/4.4

In my personal experience (~25y of GNU/Linux, mostly Debian, Ubuntu and CentOS) versions of the toolchain will not differ in a practically relevant way within a particular version of a distribution, so it is possible to build and distribute packages for a specific version of a distribution on a specific architecture for a specific series of R (4.4). I guess that if it was not possible, the effort would also not have been undertaken by PPM mentioned earlier. They offer (I skip the non-publicly available Linux distros) CentOS 7 (centos7), Rocky Linux 9 (rhel9), Ubuntu 20.04 (focal), Ubuntu 22.04 (jammy), Ubuntu 24.04 (noble), Debian 11 (bullseye), Debian 12 (bookworm). Another argument to demonstrate the feasibility is the r2u project (https://github.com/eddelbuettel/r2u). It offers CRAN as Ubuntu Binaries, but in order to build these Ubuntu Binaries it actually makes use of the binary R packages built by PPM. Quoting from https://eddelbuettel.github.io/r2u/: "For the CRAN binaries we either repackage P3M/RSPM/PPM builds (where available) or build natively." They cover all CRAN packages. The usage of PPM as a source is, of course, a weakness (in the grand scheme of things), but the point here is about the feasibility of building the packages in a portable way per version of a particular distribution, architecture etc.

I do understand arguments pro 'distribution binaries' (e.g. dependency resolution of system dependencies), but there are also arguments pro 'CRAN binaries' (binary builds of the R packages), since it can be convenient to allow for fast installation of arbitrary R packages without the need of more general sudo rights (required for installation of distribution binaries).

If R-core/CRAN maintainers agree that the answer to my first question is 'no', I am fine with that, but I can only know when asking.

It still leaves the answer to my second question ('official' repository layout conventions) open. It could be: 'we think it is a bad idea, so don't propose a structure' or 'we think it is a bad idea, but propose the following structure for people with bad ideas' :-).

Kind regards,
Tobias

As you brought this up, allow me to clarify: The re-use (where possible) is
simply a shortcut "where possible".  Each day when I cover updated packages,
I hit maybe 5 per cent of packages where for reasons I still cannot decipher
p3m.dev does not have a binary, so I build those 5 per cent from source.
Similarly for the approx 450 BioConductor packages all builds are from
source.

Rebuilding everything from source "just because we want to" is entirely
possible but as it is my time waiting for binaries I currently do not force
full rebuilds but I easily could. Also note that about 22% of packages
contain native code, leaving 78% which are not. Re-use is even simpler there
as these 78% as they contain only (portable) R processing. So if we wanted to
compile all native packages for Ubuntu, we could. It is a resourcing issue
that has not yet been a prioruty for me. Inaki does it for Fedora, Detlef
does it for OpenSUSE.

The more important point of these package is the full system integration. You
do get _all_ binary dependencies declared, exactly as a distribution-native
package (of which Debian/Ubuntu have a bit over 1k) would. Guaranteed.
Reliably. Fast. That is a big step up for large deployments, for testing, for
less experienced users.

So thanks for starting a discussion around this as 'we' as a community are
falling a bit short here. One open question is if we could pull something off
that works like the Python wheels and offers cross-distro builds, ideally
without static linking. Your "CRAN libraries" added to the ld.so path may do
this. I do not know how feasible / involved this would be so so far I
concentrated on doing something simpler -- but feasible and reliable by
working exactly as the distribution packages work.

All that said, thanks for the starting this discussion!

Cheers, Dirk

And for completeness, [1] is where we painstakingly* maintain a list
of system dependencies, [2] is where the daily magic happens for
keeping track of CRAN, and [3] performs the heavy-lifting and
publishes an RPM repository with the result.

Indeed, thank you, Tobias.

It would be perfectly feasible to maintain sync'ed builds (in terms of
version) of system dependencies at CRAN-provided (RPM, APT...)
repositories as compat packages for various distributions, then all
packages could be built once and shipped everywhere (i.e. cross-distro
builds). Collaterally, this would increase reproducibility of package
checks to a certain extent.

I offered my help in these matters in the past, but was kindly
declined. That hand remains extended.

Great discussion.

Just to note another example I don't think was mentioned -- The r-universe
project also builds binaries for Linux (Ubuntu latest)
https://docs.r-universe.dev/install/binaries.html (as well as other targets
including wasm).  It also provides binaries for Bioconductor and packages
on any git-based version control platform (e.g. GitHub).

R Universe is open source and a top-level project of the R Consortium.

Cheers,

Carl

Adding a different project to this discussion:

Recently at the R repository working group a project to provide them for
multiple distributions and toolchain was presented.
See the documentation about what do they (Patrick Schratz) share:
https://docs.r-package-binaries.devxy.io/index.html

The existence of these projects (Alpine, RedHat, Fedora, Ubuntu, r2u, P3M,
r-universe, ...) providing binaries show there is interest even if there
are multiple combinations of platforms, toolchains and library versions.
If these projects cooperate between them (as shown by r2u project) and with
CRAN, I think this will reduce duplicated effort and help the users (and
repositories).
Binaries could be served in multiple places matching what R requires and/or
what the distribution uses without much more (technical) effort.

Cheers,

Llu?s

Yes ... but these are 'naked' binaries as created by 'R CMD INSTALL --build'
but without system integration (and as such mirror what p3m.dev does). This
has its merits (it is simpler, can cover more OS variants) but it is also
more limited.

What we (ie Detlef, Inaki, myself) myself do for the distros is fundamentally
different. Both are merits, both can coexist, but I like the added 'oomph'
you get by integrating properly with the distribution you deploy on.  Ubuntu
is a pretty useful base case.

If this terms of service is the main sticking point, I could certainly find
out if we could change them. From a quick read, my personal sense (with no
internal exploration whatsoever) is that these (a) were probably written by
a lawyer with no specific understanding of PPM, let alone that these are
binaries built from open-source packages, and (b) probably aren't legally
binding anyway (since for most PPM usage, people downloading packages never
see the TOS).

In case it wasn't clear - precisely this was my point, and I was counting on all those doing the hard work already like Dirk to speak up (thanks, Dirk and I?aki). I'm not convinced that "naked" binaries are that useful, so just creating a new subdirectory isn't a solution IMHO. It works for some cases, but not in general - many can build their specific binaries, but it doesn't mean they work for others. The real work has to be done by people that have experience like Dirk and others mentioned above, not CRAN. Any such binaries are tied to the R build (just like macOS CRAN R sets its platform/arch target so it can use the CRAN binaries), so it requires cooperation across the spectrum including the distros. That said, the Linux maintainers are certainly invited to liaise with CRAN if they think it would be beneficial to host things on CRAN - we have done in the past, but with the explosion of distros and releases the trend was to go do the distros instead.

Cheers,
Simon

> In case it wasn't clear - precisely this was my point, and I was counting on all those doing the hard work already like Dirk to speak up (thanks, Dirk and I?aki). I'm not convinced that "naked" binaries are that useful, so just creating a new subdirectory isn't a solution IMHO. It works for some cases, but not in general - many can build their specific binaries, but it doesn't mean they work for others.

The "naked binaries" are widely used, and therefore probably useful to
many folks, me included. Some standardisation on paths would be
incredibly useful, even if CRAN would not offer such binaries, other
repositories could.

Note that Dirks apt packages are literally repackaged binaries form
p3m, for convenience of ubuntu (root) users. As Dirk noted, some
people prefer installing binaries via apt rather than
install.packages(), which is all fine, but methods both have pros and
cons. However, any arguments against p3m based on TOS or compatibility
will extend to the repackaged apt binaries, so I don't think that
argument holds.

Sure, but naked binaries can (and do) break more often i.e. real example from
just last week in another project p3m served a stringr dependency via a
stringi binary with a wrong libicu* outside of the particular release,
breaking.  That simply cannot and hence will not happen at r2u.

But choice is good. If people want to manually manage their system
dependencies they surely, they can also outsource it to another layer. As you
say, all trade-offs and if you are happy with naked binaries more power to
you. I prefer the proper integration and that's what I built.

Some people prefer having all their binaries *managed* by apt/dnf, but
still using install.packages() to trigger that work. I count myself
there, and that's what I built.

Just a +1 on this point and many thanks to Dirk for providing r2u, which we happily use to install R packages on our Linux servers.

Ditto. It really is automagical!

FWIW - I think this integration with the distributions is key to a painless experience. Perhaps a better question is to ask Dirk, I?aki et al. what their pain points are and whether they need any additional assistance? E.g. I'm aware of discussions around System Requirements that could help:

Subject: [Rd] A few problems with Sys.setLanguage()
Message-ID: <20250211165927.7fd4f2d8@arachnoid>

Hello R-devel,

Currently, Sys.setLanguage() interprets an empty/absent environment
variable LANGUAGE to mean unset="en", which disagrees with gettext():
it defaults to the LC_MESSAGES category of the current locale [1]. As a
result, on systems with $LANGUAGE normally unset, Sys.setLanguage(...)
returns "en" instead of the language previously in effect. I would like
to suggest making the default unset = Sys.getlocale("LC_MESSAGES")
instead of "en" so that Sys.setLanguage(Sys.setLanguage(anything))
would not reset language to English. Making Sys.setLanguage() accept an
empty string or NA to reset or remove LANGUAGE (and allowing
Sys.setLanguage() to return that value) could also be an option.

Additionally, there is a number of problems with the way
Sys.setLanguage() handles R having started up in the C locale, some of
them easier to solve than others.

gettext() disables translation lookup only when the LC_MESSAGES locale
category is "C" or "POSIX", so the current test for identical("C",
Sys.getlocale()) will miss the situations when not all locale
categories are set to "C". I think the correct test should be
Sys.getlocale("LC_MESSAGES") %in% c("C", "POSIX", "C.UTF-8", "C.utf8").
(On my GNU/Linux system, setting a "POSIX" locale returns it as "C",
but I don't think that's guaranteed to happen everywhere.)

So what should Sys.setLanguage(lang, force=TRUE) do when the current
LC_MESSAGES locale category disables translation? "en_US.UTF-8" is not
guaranteed to be present on a given system. POSIX documents 'locale -a'
to list available locales [2], so R could attempt something like:

# any locales except C.*/POSIX which disable translation?
system("locale -a", intern = TRUE) |>
 setdiff(c("C", "C.UTF-8", "C.utf8", "POSIX")) -> candidates
locale <- if (any(mask <- startsWith(candidates, lang))) {
 candidates[mask][[1]]
} else if (length(candidates)) {
 candidates[[1]]
} else {
 "en_US.UTF-8" # maybe it's available despite 'locale -a' failing?
}
lcSet <- Sys.setlocale("LC_MESSAGES", locale)

Unfortunately, that's not all: translations are also affected by the
LC_CTYPE category of the current locale, and gettext() will try to
convert the translations into that locale's encoding before returning
them. What about LC_CTYPE being "C"? Sometimes gettext() is able to
transliterate:

$ LC_CTYPE=C LANGUAGE=ru R -q -s -e 'foo'
Oshibka: ob``ekt 'foo' ne najden
Vy`polnenie ostanovleno

And sometimes it's not:

$ LC_CTYPE=C LANGUAGE=zh_CN R -q -s -e 'foo'
??: ?????'foo'
???? # <-- these are \x3F question marks, not replacement characters

There doesn't seem to be a portable way to determine a locale with an
encoding that would be appropriate in the current session. For example,
on my system, only 4 locales out of 11 listed by 'locale -a' use UTF-8
as their encoding (and sometimes UTF-8 is the wrong choice when I'm
using 'luit' with a non-UTF-8 environment).

R could try to force the same locale for LC_CTYPE as it sets
LC_MESSAGES, or force a UTF-8 locale if it finds one, or leave LC_CTYPE
as it is. All of these options have their downsides. How helpful is
Sys.setLanguage(force = TRUE) in practice?

Ivan

[1] The environment variables used for gettext() are listed at the
following resources:
https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Locale-Environment-Variables.html
https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/basedefs/V1_chap08.html#tag_08_02
The exact lookup procedure is also documented here:
https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/functions/dngettext.html
In short, if the LC_MESSAGES category of the current locale is
"C" or "POSIX", gettext() does not translate. (GNU gettext additionally
disables translation for "C.UTF-8".) Otherwise it consults the LANGUAGE
environment variable. If that variable is absent or empty, it uses the
LC_MESSAGES category of the current locale. When a program calls
setlocale(category, ""), $LANG provides the default value for all
categories, which is overridden by the $LC_* variables for individual
categories, which are all overridden by $LC_ALL.

Thank you, all, for the valuable input and reactions. Let me summarize.

I. choice is good 

Many people find 'naked binaries' useful and many people find 'distribution binaries' useful. In our own work, we see a myriad of R deployments and installations with very different processes in place and in certain cases 'naked binaries' are more convenient than 'distribution binaries'. In other cases, it is the other way around. Both deserve their place in the R world.

II. outsource to another layer

In case of 'naked binaries' dependency management indeed needs to be outsourced to another layer. People typically use either a data store (e.g. the Github repo I?aki mentioned - https://github.com/cran4linux/sysreqs or others e.g. https://github.com/r-hub/r-system-requirements). Other people add a REST API on top, which is e.g. what the PPM does (sysreqs resources in https://packagemanager.posit.co/__api__/swagger/index.html#/). To give a taste of how outsourcing to another layer looks like: to build reproducible environments we automatically generate Dockerfiles starting from the R code of a project. During the process of generating the Dockerfile, the package dependencies of the relevant packages are queried (using one of the sources above) and used to automagically insert the appropriate 'apt install' commands above and prior to the relevant install.packages commands in the Dockerfile.

III. goal in itself or ingredient for distribution packages

The building of 'naked binaries' are a necessary step in the process of building the 'distribution packages'. To some the naked binary is the end goal (often used in combination with a data source on dependencies). To others it is part of the ingredients for the end goal (distribution package). In both scenarios, it makes sense to store these naked binaries somewhere in order not to duplicate the builds. I personally think CRAN would be a good place to store these since it would be a neutral, central place that immediately gives a seal of quality and trust.

IV. repository layout

Many organizations have internal repositories mimicking a CRAN layout. Also many tool developers make certain assumptions on the repository layout. E.g. if one wants versioned package installs of source packages, one goes to src/contrib/Archive/$PACKAGE_NAME/ to retrieve the version. This is not explicitly documented and I am glad to hear Jeroen thinks such standardization would be
incredibly useful. Currently, the hosting of naked binaries actually makes use of a trick to put the packages under /src/contrib as in https://cran.r-universe.dev/bin/linux/noble/4.4/src/contrib/BayesERtools_0.2.0.tar.gz
While handy, it is a bit odd and may be confusing to some. We can further work out the specs, but a generalization of the repository layout that allows to also have an Archive for binary packages (for Windows, MacOS, naked binaries) would be very useful to be able to have fast versioned package installation. This is important if you want to combine performance and reproducible environments (which are impossible to achieve with the latest binary versions - even when using distribution binaries). This is not a request for CRAN to offer all versions of binary packages, but if the layout is clearly specified, other package manager infrastructure (public or internal to organizations) can fill this gap.

My message makes me think of the New Year Wish List mails Gabor Grothendieck tended to send out ~two decades ago (and maybe more recently) and I hope it triggers further discussion and ideas.

Thanks again!

Kind regards,
Tobias

Subject: [Rd] More precise documentation of on.exit() [when leaving function
 vs. "context"]
Message-ID: <CAPRVBcxZJF7W1=Ha6UWKHt4kFka4HsaWVR4FvZHETdim_7YrGQ@mail.gmail.com>

The current documentation of ?on.exit reads [1]

> `on.exit` records [`expr`] as needing to be executed when the current function exits...

This is almost always how it is used, however I don't see that as
explaining this other common way to use on.exit():

local({
  old = setwd(...)
  on.exit(setwd(old))
  readLines(...)
})

There's not really a "function" here. It may be that the actual
implementation of 'local()' eventually runs this code
indistinguishably from a function, which I'm not sure -- all I see is
that local() is a wrapper of eval.parent(), so it doesn't _look_ to me
like that's the case.

I'm not sure this word has a precise meaning in R but I think of
on.exit() as running upon leaving the "context" in this case. Would
that be an improvement? Is this more an "unintentional" benefit that
local() can be used like this?

I've definitely seen usage like this [2] that I've recommended just be
re-written with local instead:

(\(x) { old = setwd(...); on.exit(setwd(old)); readLines(...) })()

I'll also note that while this approach to using on.exit() is not
uncommon, and quite a useful idiom, it does not appear in the examples
either in ?on.exit or in ?local [3].

(I also don't see mention of these in any other R manual [4][5])

local(expr) is essentially equivalent to (function() expr)().

['Essentially' because in the interpreted implementation there might
currently be slight differences, though if there are we would want to
eventually get rid of them. For compiled code the two are exactly
equivalent.]

I don't see any benefits of changing this wording in ?on.exit that
would outweigh the costs.

In principle I don't object to noting in ?local that local(expr) is
just syntactic sugar for (function() expr)(), but not until someone
spends some time making sure it is exactly true for the interpreted
case; not something I could justify giving high priority to.

I'm not sure I would want to encourage this. Using tryCatch with a
finally expression seems clearer to me:

local({ old <- setwd(...); tryCatch(readLines(...), finally = setwd(old)) })

Best,

It would probably be best if we can avoid going the "syntactic sugar" way. It also happens in with():

> with(airquality,{on.exit(print("hi")); print("ho")})
[1] "ho"
[1] "hi"

and I don't see a nice way of recasting that as a function call. So maybe just say something like  "on.exit() also works in other evaluations of compound expressions in a separate scope, like local() or with()"?

Message-ID: <CAEjRNrmHbDLWwk0_JKcPrZaKVUPHfFATbaV-aLPvaNMAyxQMTw@mail.gmail.com>

To R-devel,


In a future release of R, would it be possible to
export tools:::analyze_license()? This would make it easier to implement
copyright protections in alternative CRAN-like repositories. I would like
to be able to programmatically scan an individual license string before
accepting a new package.

Subject: [Rd] patch to model matrix to improve error messages
Message-ID: <5702d5c7-e56e-4ca7-a3ca-e7b204f06044@gmail.com>

   I posted this to r-bugzilla already 
<https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18860>, but I would be 
interested to see if anyone here has comments (fewer people track 
r-bugzilla closely ...)

   The issue: if a variable reference in a model.frame() formula is 
missing from the data but matches a function found elsewhere in the 
environment (e.g. `count()` in `dplyr`), the  user gets the opaque error 
message "object is not a matrix".

   If the variable reference is missing from the data, but matches (e.g. 
a list or list-like object (e.g., a data frame), then we get the more 
useful error "invalid type (TYPE) for variable 'VARIABLE'"

   The issue is that model frame tries to compute the number of rows of 
the data before it tests the type of each column. If we switch the order 
of operations so that the columns are tested first, we get a much more 
useful error message.

   This change seems harmless, but of course I wouldn't be surprised if 
someone can come up with a reasonable scenario where it causes problems ...

    More details/examples in the bug report linked above.  The relevant 
bits of source code are here

model.c row/column checking:

nrows() function:

Subject: [Rd] Customizing width of input in Rterm
Message-ID: <725b0cf4-4874-4747-9bba-4ae24891ba38@sjd.es>

Hi all,

When using Rterm.exe (on Windows, I didn?t check Linux) only a limited 
number of characters is displayed in the input lines, independent on the 
|width| option, and, when navigating through the command history this 
becomes very uncomfortable, since a command is not fully displayed and, 
for example, it is very difficult to know which parts of a command are 
being edited.

I know, using Linux you can avoid using Rterm. And using Windows, the 
first option is RGui. However, Rterm is the default for some editor/IDE 
plugins/extensions, such as NVim-R for ViM or also for VS Code. In fact, 
searching on the web for the reported issue, I found it reported several 
times to the R extension plugin for VS Code.

https://github.com/REditorSupport/vscode-R/issues/57

https://github.com/REditorSupport/vscode-R/issues/415

https://github.com/REditorSupport/vscode-R/issues/1438

Would it be possible to allow longer lines to be displayed, at least to 
the terminal width, or to customize the number of columns displayed?

Thank you for your time and for maintaining R, it?s a great work!

Best regards,

Iago

a data frame only extraction works.  All lines below give
the expected answer except the last line which gives the error message

Hello,

R [1] and RStudio (now Posit) [2] are different things. Though I don't 
speak for any of the two, you should address Posit directly.

[2] https://posit.co/

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

The patch at the end of this message reads the console width on startup
and handles the console resize events while getline() is running. The
automatic resizing doesn't look nice due to gl_redraw() starting a new
line newline before redrawing the prompt, but it works.

This may have accessibility implications since it changes the behaviour
of Rterm.exe, which is what A. Jonathan R. Godfrey recommends for blind
Windows users [1]. I've experimented with NVDA and didn't notice
anything breaking in Windows 10 terminal or mintty.exe, but it's hard
to be sure without the real experience of using a screen reader.

Is this approach worth adopting? Is it better to erase the current line
instead of starting a new one? options(setWidthOnResize) could be
implemented similarly but may require more care due to
R_SetOptionWidth(...) evaluating R code.
