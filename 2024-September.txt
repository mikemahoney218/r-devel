Subject: [Rd] R compilation (revision 87083) failed after upgrade to Ubuntu
 24.04 (libtirpc missing)
Message-ID: <MM0P280MB0008F1C95663520452BBDEB1F0912@MM0P280MB0008.SWEP280.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Following an upgrade from Ubuntu 22.04 LTS to 24.04.1, revision 87083 failed to compile with an error:

"No rule to make target '/usr/include/tirpc/rpc/types.h', needed by 'saveload.o'"

where the file /usr/include/tirpc/rpc/types.h did not exist. After installing libtirpc-dev:

> sudo apt install libtirpc-dev

compilation proceeded smoothly. I understand that this may be local to my system.

Sincerely, Mark.

Cleaning up this way in principle would probably be fine, but R already 
has support for re-using connections. Even more, R can download files in 
parallel (in a single thread), which particularly helps with bigger 
latencies (e.g. typically users connecting from home, etc). See 
?download.file(), look for "simultaneous".

I've improved the existing support in R-devel and made it the default in 
install.packages() and download.packages(). I am seeing speedups 
somewhere between 2x and 9x on several systems (with quiet=TRUE) when 
downloading many packages.

Sequential downloads by default (quiet=FALSE) show a progress bar, which 
can be rather slow, particularly on Windows. Turning that off can help 
with slow downloads in already released versions of R. Consequently, via 
disabling the progress bar, the speedups with R-devel could seem even 
bigger than the range.

A common practice when installing/checking say all packages from CRAN or 
Bioconductor is to set up a local mirror of the repositories and 
download/update it with "rsync". When R then "downloads" packages from 
the local mirror using the "file://" protocol, it completely avoids 
these problems. The increased performance of download in R-devel cannot 
beat this setup.

However, the improvement should help a little bit users installing 
binary packages (on Windows, macOS), where the download time can play a 
visible role, when they install packages with many (uninstalled) 
dependencies. Users installing from source, particularly with packages 
needing compilation, would probably not notice.

  aa <- array(dim = 5:3)

  nrow(aa)

Hi Gabor,

In strictly reading the help files for both nrow() and row(), the 'x' argument in the former case is "a vector, array, data frame, or NULL.", whereas in the latter case it is "a matrix-like object, that is one with a two-dimensional dim.".

Thus, I would expect row() to fail on a >= 3-dimensional array, as your example shows.

In reading the help file for slice.index(), there is the following in the See Also section:

"row and col for determining row and column indexes; in fact, these are special cases of slice.index corresponding to MARGIN equal to 1 and 2, respectively when x is a matrix."

further differentiating the behavior of row() and col() as more specific implementations in the 2-dimensional case.

To my read then, the difference in behavior appears to be intentional and expected.

Regards,

Marc Schwartz

Suggest you look at dplyr::mutate as this functionality is widely used
there and has shown itself to be useful.

Why would a design made by perhaps different people at different times have to be consistent?

Why complicate a simple design meant to be used in 2-D objects to also handle other things?

It is a bit like asking why for a vector you cannot use the same verb to measure length as in one sense a vector is about the same as a 1-D matrix. Why use length(vec) and not nrow(vec) or something

Thank you for looking at this. A few ideas wrt parallel downloading:

Additional improvement on Windows can be achieved by enabling the
nghttp2 driver in libcurl in rtools, such that it takes advantage of
http2 multiplexing for parallel downloads
(https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18664).

Moreover, one concern is that install.packages() may fail more
frequently on low bandwidth connections due to reaching the "download
timeout" when downloading files in parallel:

R has an unusual definition of the http timeout, which by default
aborts in-progress downloads after 60 seconds for no obvious reason.
(by contrast, browsers enforce a timeout on unresponsive/stalled
downloads only, which can be achieved in libcurl by setting
CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT or CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_TIME).

The above is already a problem on slow networks, where large packages
can fail to install with a timeout error in the download stage. Users
may assume there must be a problem with the network, as it is not
obvious that machines on slower internet connection need to work
around R's defaults and modify options(timeout) before
install.packages(). This problem could become more prevalent when
using parallel downloads while still enforcing the same total timeout.

For example: the MacOS binary for package "sf" is close to 90mb, hence
currently, under the default R settings of options(timeout=60),
install.packages will error with a download timeout on clients with
less than 1.5MB/s bandwidth. But with the parallel implementation,
install.packages() will share the bandwidth on 6 parallel downloads,
so if "sf" is downloaded with all its dependencies, we need at least
9MB/s (i.e. a 100mbit connection) for the default settings to not
cause a timeout.

Hopefully this can be revised to enforce the timeout on stalled
downloads only, as is common practice.

It can be informative to look at what the actual functions being discussed do.

Dim is an internal, meaning written in some variant of C, perhaps:

> dim
function (x)  .Primitive("dim")

The function nrow, in my distribution, actually just calls dim() and throws away one dimension:

> nrow
function (x) 
dim(x)[1L]
<bytecode: 0x0000022df4d6f348>
<environment: namespace:base>

The function row is a bit related in calling dim in one of several ways:

> row
function (x, as.factor = FALSE) 
{
    if (as.factor) {
        labs <- rownames(x, do.NULL = FALSE, prefix = "")
        res <- factor(.Internal(row(dim(x))), labels = labs)
        dim(res) <- dim(x)
        res
    }
    else .Internal(row(dim(x)))
}
<bytecode: 0x0000022d87fbfb98>
<environment: namespace:base>

Does this shed any light on why the result may be inconsistent?

Subject: Re: [Rd] Inconsistency between row and nrow

Hi Gabor,

In strictly reading the help files for both nrow() and row(), the 'x' argument in the former case is "a vector, array, data frame, or NULL.", whereas in the latter case it is "a matrix-like object, that is one with a two-dimensional dim.".

Thus, I would expect row() to fail on a >= 3-dimensional array, as your example shows.

In reading the help file for slice.index(), there is the following in the See Also section:

"row and col for determining row and column indexes; in fact, these are special cases of slice.index corresponding to MARGIN equal to 1 and 2, respectively when x is a matrix."

further differentiating the behavior of row() and col() as more specific implementations in the 2-dimensional case.

To my read then, the difference in behavior appears to be intentional and expected.

Regards,

Marc Schwartz

In the following nrow provides the expected result but row gives an
error. I would have thought that they would both work or both fail.


aa <- array(dim = 5:3)


nrow(aa)
## [1] 5


row(aa)
## Error in row(aa) : a matrix-like object is required as argument to 'row'


# this does work:
slice.index(aa, 1)

Subject: [Rd] Documentation cross references
Message-ID: <CAN+W6_sBbuyThDTJX27rYAxwyrZLBsm1FKYtDtRnttAYP+6Ltg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am checking the cross references at CRAN and base R, and I am having
trouble understanding how to reconcile the documentation and how R
help links work.

Checking the documentation [1] it seems that in a cross reference such
as \link[pkg:x]{text} x should be a topic (created with \alias{topic}
in R documentation).
But I found some cases exploring the output of
tools::base_rdxrefs_db() where it is a file name (without the .Rd
extension).
For instance, ?print has a link with text (Target as named by the
output) ".print.via.format" and the anchor "tools:print.via.format".
The topic would be print.via.format, but if one uses:
help(topic = "print.via.format", package = "tools"):
     No documentation for 'print.via.format' in specified packages and
libraries:
     you could try '??print.via.format'

However, if one accesses the html help page and clicks
.print.via.format, is redirected to the right help page (found in the
REPL too with help(topic = ".print.via.format", package = "tools") ).

I see a paragraph in R 4.1 NEWS about a change in behaviour [2] (also
hinted in WRE), where it is described as:
... "and fall back to a file link only if the topic is not found in
the target package. The earlier rule which prioritized file names over
topics can be restored by setting the environment variable
_R_HELP_LINKS_TO_TOPICS_ to a false value."

The internal variable _R_HELP_LINKS_TO_TOPICS_ isn't mentioned on
R-internals and this behaviour of html pages is not mentioned on WRE.
 - Perhaps documentation at R-internals and WRE could be updated to
show how html page links are created?
 - And/or the behaviour could continue the path started on R 4.1 and
start complaining about anchors pointing to files?

In the second case, ~10 links in base R would be affected but on CRAN
this could affect ~1700 more packages than those currently with "Rd
cross-references" notes.

Regards,

Llu?s

Anyone who wants to cooperate and help is more than welcome to 
contribute patches to upstream MXE.

In case of nghttp2, thanks to Andrew Johnson, who contributed nghttp2 
support to upstream MXE. It will be part of the next Rtools (probably 
Rtools45).

Yes, this is work in progress, I am aware that the timeout could use 
some thought re simultaneous downloads.

If anyone wants to help with testing the current implementation of 
simultaneous download and report any bugs found, that would be nice.

OK that is good to hear.

R-universe has ran this a few thousand times to recheck packages on
r-devel on both linux and windows, and it works well. It reduces the
CI process by a few seconds, and there are less random connection
failures. If you want to inspect some recent logs for yourself, click
the rightmost column on https://r-universe.dev/builds and then on the
GitHub Actions page, look under the "Build R-devel for Windows /
Linux" runs to see the log files.

I was also able to confirm an edge case that install.packages() does
not abort if any of the dependencies fails to download with http-404,
which I think is desired behavior. If there is anything else
specifically that you would like to see tested I can look at that.

Subject: [Rd] Can gzfile be given the same method option as file
Message-ID: <CWXP123MB619012B710931D02CF91B812D0642@CWXP123MB6190.GBRP123.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Recently my employer has introduced a security system which generates SSL certificates on the fly to be able to see the content of https connections.  To make this work they add a new root certificate to the windows certificate store.

In R this causes problems because the default library used to download data from URLs doesn't look at this store, however the "wininet" download method works so where this is used then things work (albeit with a warning about future deprecation).

For functions like download.file this works great, but it fails when running readRDS:

readRDS('https://seurat.nygenome.org/azimuth/references/homologs.rds')
Error in gzfile(file, "rb") : cannot open the connection
In addition: Warning message:
In gzfile(file, "rb") :
  cannot open compressed file 'https://seurat.nygenome.org/azimuth/references/homologs.rds', probable reason 'Invalid argument'

After some debugging I see that the root cause is from the gzfile function.

> gzfile('https://seurat.nygenome.org/azimuth/references/homologs.rds') -> g
> open(g, open="r")
Error in open.connection(g, open = "r") : cannot open the connection
In addition: Warning message:
In open.connection(g, open = "r") :
  cannot open compressed file 'https://seurat.nygenome.org/azimuth/references/homologs.rds', probable reason 'Invalid argument'

If this was not a compressed file then using file rather than gzfile we can make this work by setting the url.method option:

> options("url.method"="wininet")
> file('https://seurat.nygenome.org/azimuth/references/homologs.rds') -> g
> open(g, open="r")
Warning message:
In open.connection(g, open = "r") :
  the 'wininet' method of url() is deprecated for http:// and https:// URLs

So I get a warning, but it works.

I guess this boils down to two questions:


  1.  Is it possible to add the same "method" argument to gzfile that file uses so that people in my situation have a work round?
  2.  Given the warnings we're getting when using wininet, are their plans to make windows certficates be supported in another way?

Thanks

Simon.

I don't think that gzfile works with URLs. gzcon(), on the other hand,
does work with url() connections, which accepts the 'method' argument
and the getOption('url.method') default.

h <- readRDS(url(
 'https://seurat.nygenome.org/azimuth/references/homologs.rds'
))

But that only works with gzip-compressed files. For example, CRAN's
PACKAGES.rds is xz-compressed, and I don't see a way to read it the
same way:

readBin(
 index <- file.path(
  contrib.url(getOption('repos')['CRAN']),
  'PACKAGES.rds'
 ), raw(), 5
) |> rawToChar()
# [1] "\xfd7zXZ" <-- note the "7zXZ" header
readRDS(url(index))
# Error in readRDS(url(index)) : unknown input format

What does libcurlVersion() return for you? In theory, it should be
possible to make libcurl use schannel and therefore the system
certificate store for TLS verification purposes.

Thankyou!  This helped a lot.  I had mis-understood some of the chain of functions which got to the eventual failure.  I can confirm that it does indeed work if you create a url() first and it picks the appropriate back end as long as the url.method option is set.

For the schannel back end I have:

> libcurlVersion()
[1] "8.6.0"
attr(,"ssl_version")
[1] "(OpenSSL/3.2.1) Schannel"
attr(,"libssh_version")
[1] "libssh2/1.11.0"

However I can't get either of the curl related methods to work.

I realise that this may not be as simple as the certificate not being seen, and that the system here may not fake the revocation infrastructure too, but I don't see that this is going to change, and it's only the winet method which actually allows anything to connect.

I don't think that gzfile works with URLs. gzcon(), on the other hand, does work with url() connections, which accepts the 'method' argument and the getOption('url.method') default.

h <- readRDS(url(
 'https://seurat.nygenome.org/azimuth/references/homologs.rds'
))

But that only works with gzip-compressed files. For example, CRAN's PACKAGES.rds is xz-compressed, and I don't see a way to read it the same way:

readBin(
 index <- file.path(
  contrib.url(getOption('repos')['CRAN']),
  'PACKAGES.rds'
 ), raw(), 5
) |> rawToChar()
# [1] "\xfd7zXZ" <-- note the "7zXZ" header
readRDS(url(index))
# Error in readRDS(url(index)) : unknown input format

This extra error code is useful, thank you for trying the "curl"
method. https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/14315 suggests a libcurl
option and a curl command line option.

Does download.file(method = 'curl', extra = '--ssl-no-revoke') work for
you?

Since R-4.2.2, R understands the R_LIBCURL_SSL_REVOKE_BEST_EFFORT
environment variable. Does it help to set it to "TRUE" (e.g. in the
.Renviron file) before invoking download.file(method = "libcurl")?

Some extra context can be found in
news(grepl('R_LIBCURL_SSL_REVOKE_BEST_EFFORT', Text)) and
<https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18379>.

Yes!  Adding that option does indeed work and generates no warnings.

Yes, this also works and will provide a workable solution for our environment

[1] "TRUE"

Thank you so much for your help with this.  I shall implement this for the rest of our organisation.
