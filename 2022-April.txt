Subject: [Rd] png() defaults to `type = "X11"` on R compiled with support
 for cairo (but no pango)
Message-ID: <CAMigB8HHFgFqWBWqjwA1ffc62bJOxtPrq54JcUhu2PgQ7ALYiA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R Team,

* I'm observing `png()` defaulting to `type = "X11"` in R compiled
   with support for "cairo" (but not compiled with pango) run
   in "vanilla" mode
* According to `help("png", package="grDevices")` :

  > The default is set by
  > ?getOption("bitmapType")? - the ?out of the box? default is
  > ?"quartz"? or ?"cairo"? where available, otherwise ?"Xlib"?.

* "cairo" is indeed available so according to the documentation
   it should be the "out-of-the-box" default but instead
  "Xlib" is the "out-of-the-box" default.
* `X11()` also defaults to "Xlib" but `?X11` says the default is "cairo"
  only when R was built using "pangocairo" so this seems to match
  the documentation since `./configure` says there was no pango.
* Perhaps R should instead default to
 `type = "cairo"` for `X11()` and the bitmap devices
  when "cairo" is supported even if there is no "pango"?
  With `type="cairo"` I observe support for the new
  R 4.1 and R 4.2 `{grid}` graphic features
  and I avoid certain font ERRORs that hit me
  when I use `type = "X11"`.  Seems like "cairo"
  would be the better default than "X11"?

Thanks!

Trevor

Subject: [Rd] The enclosed environment does not work as expected
Message-ID: <CAGiFhPMgMZq6VeoZcxjTG0z=W4eE8HPW=X_y5Cb00pqd9LRakw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

It seems like the enclosed environment does not work well with the
loop. Here is a simple example
```
FuncGenerator <- function(value){
    function() message(value)
}

funcSets <- list()
for(i in 1:2)
    funcSets[[i]] <- FuncGenerator(i)

environment(funcSets[[1]])$value
# [1] 2
environment(funcSets[[2]])$value
# [1] 2
```
The output from the last two lines is simply 2. I expect the first
should be 1 and the second is 2. However, if I ask R to execute the
message function before accessing its environment, the result is
correct again.

```
FuncGenerator <- function(value){
    function() message(value)
}

funcSets <- list()
for(i in 1:2)
    funcSets[[i]] <- FuncGenerator(i)

## Ask to evaluate the function
for(i in 1:2){
    funcSets[[i]]()
}
# 1
# 2
environment(funcSets[[1]])$value
# [1] 1
environment(funcSets[[2]])$value
# [1] 2
```
This does not make any sense to me since the function simply prints
out its variable `value`. It should not change the value of the
variable, so I think this might be a bug in the code optimizer. This
issue can only be corrected by the loop(like the second example),
manually evaluating the function without the loop will give you the
same result as the first example.

Hi Eric,

Wow, Thanks for the explanation. Even though I know the lazy
evaluation, I never thought it can have this surprising effect. Good
to know it now.

Hello,

Another way not to fall into this surprise is to ?force the variable's 
evaluation.


FuncGenerator <- function(value){
   force(value)
   function() message(value)
}

funcSets <- list()
for(i in 1:2)
   funcSets[[i]] <- FuncGenerator(i)

environment(funcSets[[1]])$value
environment(funcSets[[2]])$value


Note that to force evaluation inside the returned function doesn't work. 
The function will get a copy of value and evaluate the copy, not what 
the function factory is getting. I too find lazy evaluation confusing 
and the best/only way is to try it out and eventualy get it right.


# wrong
FuncGenerator <- function(value){
   function(value) {
     force(value)
     message(value)
   }
}



Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Dear R devs,

I have an error that I can't understand the reason:

Error in system(sprintf("%s -Pg %s", nm, shQuote(f)), intern = TRUE) :
  '""' not found
Calls: <Anonymous> -> lapply -> FUN -> strsplit -> system

Error 1

I'm using Rcpp to build cpp package for R. Compilation has few warnings and
the library is built.

Appreciate for advice on how to resolve this issue.

Thanks,
Roman.

This does highlight a minor bug in R (an empty string is accidentally
quoted, so the absence of nm on the PATH isn't noted), but your setup
is part of the problem too, I think. How did you install Rtools? (Is it
appropriate here? Is R-pkg-devel a better fit?)

Here's the patch fixing the check (but not the reason why R can't find
nm on your machine):

Subject: [Rd] available.packages function and UNC paths
Message-ID: <9699bb8ee6e5404eb32fcef502a38e71@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca>

Hello,

I'm responsible for maintaining a mirrored internal CRAN repository for my organization. We have a script that uses the miniCRAN library to add and update packages within the repository and since the repository is stored on a network drive I have to use UNC paths when calling miniCRAN functions such as this:

updatePackages(path = '\\\\my-network-drive.net\\repos\\packages', ...)

updatePackages function in turns call pkgAvail, another miniCRAN function, which calls available.packages and then read.dcf function. However I discovered that this line in available.packages transforms the UNC path to a form that read.dcf can't use:

if (startsWith(repos, "file:///")) {tmpf <- paste0('/', substring(repos, 8L), "/PACKAGES")

This line transforms my UNC path to //\\\\my-network-drive.net\\repos\\packages, which read.dcf can't use. During debugging I found that pkgAvail transformed my UNC path to 'file:///\\\\ my-network-drive.net\\repos\\packages' and that is the path being passed to available.packages. To fix my issue I re-defined my own available.packages function and changed the line to:

if (startsWith(repos, "file:///")) {tmpf <- paste0('/', substring(repos, 10L), "/PACKAGES")

This way the UNC path being passed to read.dcf will be '/\\my-network-drive.net\\repos\\packages', which read.dcf can use. I'm wondering if similar changes can be made in the available.packages function for the next R release to automatically detect UNC paths and modify it so that it can work with UNC paths.

Thanks,

Mark

Subject: [Rd] calloc() vs. R_Calloc()
Message-ID: <CAJ=0CtBMDXf4R0DR40whvXS5i8=KUrPRqbZWC-TWWeU2DfzQjw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R devs,

I ran into a C level problem that hopefully is a quick fix to a trained eye.

Not sure if I am able to produce a minimal reproducible example, but
suppose a (test) package passes all the local tests, passes the R CMD check
and also passes the tests on both rhub and https://win-builder.r-project.org

The test GitHub repo is here:
https://github.com/dusadrian/QCAtest

As per the latest CRAN recommendation, I need to replace calloc() and
free() with R's Calloc() and Free(). In the above repo, the latest commit
does not pass the tests any longer, and the absolute single difference is
using the recommended commands in the file:
https://github.com/dusadrian/QCAtest/blob/main/src/CCubes.c

The previous initial commit of this file (which has no problems) is here:
https://github.com/dusadrian/QCAtest/blob/5fb13f44457a2071b322ad42ab579f3547d1c551/src/CCubes.c

There must be something obvious I'm doing wrong, perhaps a header missing
or not in the right place, but it just escapes me.
I've tried both Calloc() and R_Calloc(), both versions result in the same
errors.

Many thanks in advance for any hint,
Adrian

And what are the errors you run into? On which platforms, under what 
circumstances, etc? It would be much easier to give advice knowing that.

In principle, one issue you may run into when switching allocators is 
that you accidentally end up freeing by a different allocator from the 
one used to allocate it. It is common on Windows but can in principle 
happen elsewhere as well.

Also by a slightly different heap layout or different allocator 
implementation you may wake up bugs in the program not seen previously 
(use after free, invalid memory accesses, etc)

That is something I do not know yet, since the only information the server
gives is this:
https://builder.r-hub.io/status/original/QCA_3.16.tar.gz-a03b4462b41df37c6284be1d5519e8b3

I'll probably end up debugging the C code, but since the only difference is
using Free() vs free() on exactly the same objects, I suspected a mis-usage
of the R commands.

The same setup passes with no problems on my local MacOS, but the errors
still seem to occur on the Windows setup from r-hub.

Best wishes,
Adrian

This is very likely because you are freeing memory allocated by calloc() 
(or something else but not R_Calloc() in your program) using R_Free() or 
memory allocated using R_Calloc() by using free() in your program.
I would recommend checking the source code manually for that.

It is not surprising that the problem doesn't appear on other platforms 
where the allocators happen to be the same.

Hello,

Tomas is right, there are many memory operations allocating with malloc 
and freeing with R_Free:

line: variables - operation

  55: p_pichart - malloc
336: p_pichart - R_Free

236: copy_implicants - malloc
260: copy_implicants - R_Free

240: p_tempic - malloc
262: p_tempic - R_Free


And there are more cases like these. For what I've seen, the frequent 
(unique?) case is malloc/R_Free.

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Dear Rui,

Thank you so much for the response, that's a very good observation but I've
just tested and results in the same errors, unfortunately.

I have now changed all malloc()s to R_Calloc(), in the latest commit:
https://github.com/dusadrian/QCAtest/blob/main/src/CCubes.c

And yet:
https://builder.r-hub.io/status/QCA_3.16.tar.gz-e652c850de7e51c4cc1311fafe44f986

There must be something obvious I am missing, but my C knowledge is limited
and already stretched out...

Best wishes,
Adrian

Adrian,

there are many more allocations in your code - for example, you're using resize() from utils.c which uses malloc/free so it will break since it's using the wrong allocator. You may need to replace *all* allocations in your project, not just some.

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [Rd] tools:::cleanupLaTex fails to drop braces in names containing
 consecutive accented characters
Message-ID: <CWLP265MB3505DA6D823D935FEC2E9846AEE99@CWLP265MB3505.GBRP265.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

tools:::cleanupLaTex() fails to drop braces in names containing consecutive accented characters. 
For example, Ib??ez ends up rendered as Ib?{?}ez. This is a problem for high level functions, e.g. cite(). For example, after importing the following into a bibentry object, say `tmp`:

@article{DiaLop2020ejor,
  author =       { Juan Esteban Diaz and Manuel L{\'o}pez-Ib{\'a}{\~n}ez },
  title =        {Incorporating Decision-Maker's Preferences into the Automatic
                  Configuration of Bi-Objective Optimisation Algorithms},
  journal =      {European Journal of Operational Research},
  year =         2021,
  volume =       289,
  number =       3,
  pages =        {1209--1222},
  doi =          {10.1016/j.ejor.2020.07.059},
}

> cite("DiaLop2020ejor", tmp, textual = TRUE)
## Diaz and L?pez-Ib?{?}ez (2021)

Here is an example showing that it is not related to a specific accented character:

> e1 <- "Manuel L{\\'o}pez-Ib{\\'a}{\\~n}ez"
> e2 <- "Manuel L{\\'o}pez-Ib{\\~n}{\\'a}ez"
> tools:::cleanupLatex(e1)
## [1] "Manuel L?pez-Ib?{?}ez"
> tools:::cleanupLatex(e2)
[1] "Manuel L?pez-Ib?{?}ez"

This may be a problem in certain circumstances. I narrowed this down to `deparseLatex()` but it is not clear to me if a change may be need there or in parseLatex() which creates the object processed by deparseLatex. I have given more specific details of mu understanding of the problem in my comment at
https://github.com/GeoBosh/Rdpack/issues/25#issuecomment-1093336599 regarding a bug report for Rdpack.
