Thanks. It seems that TRE is now maintained again upstream, so it would 
be best to discuss this with TRE maintainers directly (if not already 
solved by https://github.com/laurikari/tre/pull/98).

The same applies to any other open TRE issues.

Thanks Tomas.  Do note that my original post also mentioned a bug or doc 
error in the PCRE docs for this regexp:

Apologies for not seeing this until now. The files on CRAN https://cran.r-project.org/src/base-prerelease/ contain R-patched versions that should be up to date. The Zurich R-patched seems to be 4.4.1 patched too now. 

The text in R-admin is a bit out of date (it predates nightly builds of tarballs on the machine that does the final releases), and so is the text on CRAN. We might change them to point to the CRAN directory as the primary source.

(Martin: Are there changes in the situation at Zurich that are relevant to this?)

Message-ID: <BE21EBCB-E162-4E1A-BC7A-13779832D311@yahoo.com>

From the R Installation and Admin manual:

	"There is a tendency for re-distributors of R to use ?enhanced? linear algebra libraries without explaining their downsides.?

There?s a downside not mentioned in the manual that caught and baffled me for a while. I was using all 64 cores of an AWS instance via parallel::mclapply() and doing matrix multiplications in the parallelized function. If the matrices were big enough the linked BLAS or LAPACK would try to use all 64 cores for each multiplication, which meant 64^2 processes or threads in some combination and that was the end of all useful work. I worked around the problem by rewriting the matrix multiply as ?colSums(x * t(y))?. It also worked to build R from source, which I guess uses the built-in BLAS and LAPACK.

Would it make sense to add a parameter somewhere, to mclapply(), say, telling R to not use multiprocessing libraries? Does R even know whether a linked library is doing multi-processing? Does R build its own BLAS and LAPACK if its also linking external ones?

Thanks,
Rob

It would be great if we had a way to limit all kinds of multiprocessing
(child processes, OpenMP threads, pthreads, forks, MPI, PVM, 'parallel'
clusters, <insert many more methods here>) in a single setting, but
there is currently no such setting, and it may be impossible to
implement. Particularly problematic may be nested parallellism:
sometimes desirable (e.g. 4-machine cluster, each machine in it using
OpenMP threads), sometimes undesired (e.g. your case). A single setting
is probably far from enough.

> Does R even know whether a linked library is doing multi-processing?

Unfortunately, no, there is no standard interface for that. Best I can
recommend is to link your R installation with FlexiBLAS and then use the
'flexiblas' CRAN package to talk to it.

I think it doesn't.

I also have this questions for this. I wonder if R initiates a system environment or options to instruct the packages on the number of cores to use?

It doesn't have to be mandatory for now, but at least package maintainers can have shared consensus and start to adopt this humble settings rather than abusing parallel::detectCores() to max out the number of threads by default.

I believe one can control the number of BLAS threads via the `RhpcBLASctl` package: https://cran.r-project.org/package=RhpcBLASctl I?ve definitely used it in the other direction, when `betareg` was *not* multiprocessing. https://stackoverflow.com/a/66540693/570918

> "Does R build its own BLAS and LAPACK if it's also linking external ones?"

No, it will not. On Conda Forge, there was even some trickery on certain platforms (osx-arm64) where external BLAS/LAPACK were used, but symlinks were used to fill in the typical R delivered ones (Rblas.dylib, Rlapack.dylib) to allow previously built packages using rpath links to support the swap.

BTW, one can easily select the Conda Forge BLAS/LAPACK implementation. It doesn't provide the R-vendored ones, but the reference standard is Netlib, e.g., `conda install 'blas=*=netlib'`. But that's also the slowest by all metrics and on all platforms.

> I wonder if R initiates a system environment or options to instruct

A lot of thought and experience with various HPC systems went into
availableCores(), a function from the zero-dependency 'parallelly'
package by Henrik Bengtsson:
https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/parallelly/html/availableCores.html
If you cannot accept a pre-created cluster object or 'future' plan or
'BiocParallel' parameters or the number of OpenMP threads from the
user, this must be a safer default than parallel::detectCores().

Building such a limiter into R poses a number of problems. Here is a
summary from a previous discussion on R-pkg-devel [1] with wise
contributions from Dirk Eddelbuettel, Reed A. Cartwright, Vladimir
Dergachev, and Andrew Robbins.

 - R is responsible for the BLAS it is linked to and therefore must
   actively manage the BLAS threads when the user sets the thread
   limit. This requires writing BLAS-specific code to talk to the
   libraries, like done in FlexiBLAS and the RhpcBLASctl package. Some
   BLASes (like ATLAS) only have a compile-time thread limit. R should
   somehow give all threads to BLAS by default but take them away when
   some other form of parallelism is requested.

 - Should R be managing the OpenMP thread limit by itself? If not,
   that's a lot of extra work for every OpenMP-using package developer.
   If yes, R is now responsible for initialising OpenMP.

 - Managing the BLAS and OpenMP thread limits is already a hard problem
   because some BLASes may or may not be following the OpenMP thread
   limits.

 - What if two packages both consult the thread limit and create N^2
   processes as a result of one calling the other? Dividing a single
   computer between BLAS threads, OpenMP threads, child processes and
   their threads needs a very reliable global inter-process semaphore.
   R would have to grow a jobserver like in GNU Make, a separate
   process because the main R thread will be blocked waiting for the
   computation result, especially if we want to automatically recover
   job slots from crashed processes. That's probably not impossible,
   but involves a lot of OS-specific code.

 - What happens with the thread limit when starting remote R processes?
   It's best to avoid having to set it manually. If multiple people
   unknowingly start R on a shared server, how to avoid the R instances
   competing for the CPU (or the ownership of the semaphore)?

 - It will take a lot of political power to actually make this scheme
   work. The limiter can only be cooperative (unless you override the
   clone() syscall and make it fail? I expect everything to crash after
   that), so it takes one piece of software to unknowingly ignore the
   limit and break everything.

Possibly related to this, it seems that
https://cran.r-project.org/src/base-prerelease/R-latest.tar.gz
is not available any more.

This file was very convenient, because it pointed to R-RC, R-beta, R-alpha
or R-patched, as appropriate.

Our nightly "next version of R" builds [1] depend on it. Do you think
you can still create this file or link?

Thank you,

Exactly. I was in the process of getting the CRAN texts to point at base-prerelease, rather than Martin's versions i Zurich and decided that his names were better than mine. "R-latest" makes better sense for the actual releases over in src/base.

Thanks!

So, to make sure I got this right, when the time of beta, alpha, RC
comes, they'll also have a link called R-patched.tar.gz?

Thanks again!

This is a change in documented behavior in PCRE. PCRE2 10.43 
(share/man/man3/pcre2pattern.3) says:

"If the first number is omitted, the lower limit is taken as zero; in 
this case the upper limit must be present. X{,4} is interpreted as 
X{0,4}. In earlier versions such a sequence was not interpreted as a 
quantifier. Other regular expression engines may behave either way."

And the changelog:

"29. Perl 5.34.0 changed the meaning of (for example) {,3} which did not 
used to be treated as a quantifier. Now it is interpreted as {0,3} and 
PCRE2 has changed to match. Note that {,} is still not a quantifier."

Sadly the previous behavior was also documented in pcre2pattern.3:

"For example, {,6} is not a quantifier, but a literal string of four 
characters"

I've confirmed with R built with PCRE2 10.42, 10.43 and 10.44. In 
practice, users would most likely see the new behavior on Windows, where 
Rtools44 has PCRE2 10.43.

The R documentation (?regex) refers to the PCRE2 documentation for 
"complete details", mentioning how to find out what is the version of 
PCRE(2) used.? I've now added a warning about that PCRE behavior may 
change between versions, with the {,m} as an example. I don't think we 
can do much more - I don't think we should be replicating the PCRE 
documentation/changelog - but we could add more examples, if any 
important appear. Also, we don't want to write R programs that depend on 
concrete versions of PCRE.

It is a good thing that ?regex doesn't document "{,m}", because it 
cannot be used reliably/portably. One should use some of the documented 
forms, instead, i.e. "{0,m}". Indeed there is the problem of how to use 
only the documented subset of behavior (in ?regex), because one also 
needs to avoid accidentally running into undocumented expressions with 
special meaning, like in this case. But perhaps still authors could try 
to defensively avoid risky expressions in literals in patterns, such as 
those involving "{}" or otherwise similar to documented expressions with 
a special meaning.

Tomas

Yep. (Perhaps slightly unfortunate, but a varying name would be, um, counterproductive.)
