Since the CRAN e-mails quote the R CMD check messages verbatim, would
it have been enough if R CMD check suggested using --compact-vignettes?

Or is there anything else you would prefer to be reworded? Should the

project to improve the R CMD check messages [*], but I managed to miss
almost all of it.

Subject: [Rd] After package update, old S4 method is dispatched
Message-ID: <CA+6hu7ekxwdH55eSVs5-PxfCv75khNUURbHjT2rB_jLSrCNgZw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello R-devel,

I hope that you are all doing well and that this is the right place to
discuss my somewhat mysterious issue with S4.

On our Ubuntu server, we have "mirt" package installed which defines S4
method for "coef" standard generic. We updated the package with the usual
"install.packages", restarted, and observer error calling coef on mirt
object that should not be possible: "Error in which: argument "nfact" is
missing, with no default" (which has no such argument).

After days of investigation, I found that from mirt 1.37 to current 1.40,
the method changed as well as some internal functions used by the method.
The aforementioned error stems from the fact that these internal ordinary
functions were changed properly as we updated the package, but the S4
method dispatched stuck with the 1.37 version. I am by no means an expert
on S4 matter, but I know that these are cached to some extent. I thought
the cache is session-bound and have no idea how the issue can possibly
persist even after a complete reboot of the machine. I can detach and
library() mirt in one R session which solves the issue temporarily, but
emerges right back in any new R session.

Sadly, I cannot provide any reproducible example as I am completely unaware
of the cause and even I cannot reproduce this issue outside of the server.

Any insights on how this issue could have started would be highly
appreciated.

Best regards,
Jan Net?k

Dear Ivan

I was bitten by this recently but fortunately Rolf had beaten me to 
writing a question. The one thing which really surprised me is that the 
current message tells me how much space it would have saved if it had 
compressed the files in which case my immediate response was "Well, why 
didn't you compress them then?".

Thank you for your help on this.

Subject: [Rd] Problems caused by dev.off() behaviour
Message-ID: <affab490-cd9f-46e7-ab9f-37a4b13d2557@gmail.com>

I found some weird behaviour and reported it as
https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18604 and
https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues/2297, but it turns out it was user 
error.

The dev.off() function was behaving as documented, but it behaves in an 
unexpected (by me) way, and that caused the "bugs".

The issue is that

    dev.off()

doesn't always result in the previous graphics device being made 
current.  If there are two or more other open graphics devices, it won't 
choose the previous one, it will choose the next one.

I'm letting people know because this might affect other people too.  If 
you use dev.off(), don't assume it restores the previous device!

Here's my little workaround alternative:

   safe.dev.off  <- function(which = dev.cur(), prev = dev.prev()) {
     force(prev)
     dev.off(which)
     dev.set(prev)
   }

Use it just like dev.off(), but it *will* restore the previous device.

Jan,

have you re-installed all packages? If you change (update) any package that uses S4 it may be necessary to re-install all its reverse-dependencies as well since they may include cached values in their namespaces, so the easiest is to make sure you re-install all packages.

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [Rd] Should `expand.grid()` consistently drop `NULL` inputs?
Message-ID: <CABzLhzz11_7LyOUe3vzMN+rmkb7PS9cn4Yd7_LLdBihEK2QJsw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I noticed that `expand.grid()` has somewhat inconsistent behavior with
dropping `NULL` inputs. In particular, if there is a leading `NULL`,
then it ends up as a column in the resulting data frame, which seems
pretty undesirable. Also, notice in the last example that `Var3` is
used as the column name on the `NULL`, which is wrong.

I think the most consistent behavior would be to unconditionally drop
`NULL`s anywhere they appear (i.e. treat an `expand.grid()` call with
`NULL` inputs as semantically equivalent to the same call without
`NULL`s).

```
dropattrs <- function(x) {
  attributes(x) <- list(names = names(x))
  x
}

# `NULL` dropped
dropattrs(expand.grid(NULL))
#> named list()

# `NULL` dropped
dropattrs(expand.grid(1, NULL))
#> $Var1
#> numeric(0)

# Oh no! Leading `NULL` ends up in the data frame!
dropattrs(expand.grid(NULL, 1))
#> $Var2
#> NULL
#>
#> [[2]]
#> numeric(0)

# Oh no! This one does too!
dropattrs(expand.grid(1, NULL, 2))
#> $Var1
#> numeric(0)
#>
#> $Var3
#> NULL
#>
#> [[3]]
#> numeric(0)
```

Thanks,
Davis

I'm observing that if there were no previously open graphics devices then
your `safe.dev.off()` opens up a new graphics device which may be an
undesired side effect (because "surprisingly" `dev.set()` on the null
graphics device opens up a new graphics device).  To avoid that you could
check if `dev.list()` is greater than length 1L:

   safe.dev.off  <- function(which = dev.cur(), prev = dev.prev()) {
     force(prev)
     dev.off(which)
     if (length(dev.list()) > 1L) {
       dev.set(prev)
     }
   }

devices?  That's what I'm seeing on MacOS.

If there is only one graphics device then R should automatically set it as
the active graphics device so it isn't really necessary to manually set
it.  Although there wouldn't be any harm in manually setting it you only
really need to worry about setting the previous graphics device when there
are two or more devices open.

Simon,

Many thanks for your advice! The issue was that another package was
inheriting from the "mirt" class in question. Apparently, some methods are
cached at build time (is this documented anywhere?). After reinstalling the
package that extends the "mirt" class, the proper method is now being
dispatched. No other packages needed to be reinstalled.

Best,
Jan

Right, I see.  With some more fiddling, I've decided that I don't like 
the error you get if you try to close device 1, so here's the current 
version:

safe.dev.off  <- function(which = dev.cur(), prev = dev.prev()) {
   if (which != 1) {
     force(prev)
     grDevices::dev.off(which)
   }
   if (length(dev.list()))
     dev.set(prev)
   else
     c("null device" = 1)
}

This does the dev.set even if there's only one device so it can return 
the resulting device number.

Dear Luke Tierney,

Thank you for the reply and apologies for not getting back to you
earlier.

At the end of this e-mail is a large patch that makes errorcall() and
warningcall() safer by processing the format arguments before calling
any R APIs. It's fairly invasive because it rewires all error() /
warning() / errorcall() / warningcall() processing into two common
subroutines that call R_vsnprintf() as soon as possible and keep a
single message buffer afterwards. It passes make check-devel. I am open
to other, less invasive ways to implement this change.

Additionally, I fixed a problem detected by a static analyser: given
unsigned msg_len, max(msg_len - strlen(head), 0) can only be 0 if
msg_len == strlen(head). That's because both msg_len and size_t end up
being promoted to unsigned in order to compute the subtraction. I
couldn't come up with a sufficiently laconic alternative, so I left the
ternary operator in for now.

I can also implement this. Does this mean replacing every occasion of
EncodeChar(PRINTNAME(sym)) with EncodeSymbol(sym, <temporary>, sizeof
<temporary>)?

A quick scan of that discussion didn't turn up anything relevant, e.g. a 
script to produce the warning.  Could you be more specific, or just post 
the script here?

In general, a good way to locate the source of a warning is to set 
options(warn=2) to turn it into an error, and then trigger it.  The 
traceback from the error will include a bunch of junk from the code that 
catches the warning, but it will also include the context where it was 
triggered.

Indeed.

But Roger is right that it in the end, (almost surely) it is
from our {Matrix} package.

Indeed for several years now, we have tried to make the setup
leaner (and hence faster) by not explicitly define coercion
from <everything> to <everything>  because  the size of
<everything> is here about 200, and we don't want to have to provide
200^2 = 40'000  coercion methods.

Rather, Matrix package users should use to high level abstract Matrix
classes such as "sparseMatrix" or "CsparseMatrix" or
"TsparseMatrix" or "dMatrix", "symmetricMatrix".

In the case of  as(<dgCMatrix>, "dgTMatrix") , if you
replace "dgTMatrix" by "TsparseMatrix"
the result will be the same but also work in the future when the
deprecation may have been turned into a defunctation ...

There is a call to mosek and I assumed that this wasn?t going to be helpful for most R-devel recipients.  I tried Duncan?s very reasonable suggestion about options() but it didn?t produce the desired error, so perhaps this isn?t really a warning  but something else???

For those who might have rmosek installed,  I?m doing:

library(REBayes)
demo(GLmix1)

Thanks,
Roger

Just pointing out that if you do not want to SEE an error message that is
otherwise harmless, one option in R is to let the error happen but arrange
to deal with it in some way including just suppressing the message.

Thanks, Ivan, I should have had the initiative to do this myself.  I?ve now written to the Mosek folks in the hope that they will update this in Rmosek.

The details are described in news(package="Matrix") under "Changes in version
1.5-0" and implemented in Matrix:::Matrix.DeprecatedCoerce.  That version was
released in Sep 2022.

At the time, it was too disruptive to signal a proper deprecation warning
with every as(., "d(g.|.C)Matrix") call, for every reverse dependency of
Matrix, so we decided that in those most common cases we would use message()
instead of warning().   A corollary was that options(warn=n) would not have
the usual effect, so we advertised an alternative to affected maintainers:

     in R:

         options(Matrix.warnDeprecatedCoerce=n)

     on the command line:

         R_MATRIX_WARN_DEPRECATED_COERCE=n R CMD check *.tar.gz

But maybe it is time to begin signaling warnings unconditionally ...

thanks, good to know, although at my age this is the sort of knowledge that has a very short half-life. ;-)

40,000 coercion methods sounds indeed crazy. But have you considered 
having 200 coercions from ANY to <everything>?

For example the coercion from ANY to dgTMatrix would do as(as(as(from, 
"dMatrix"), "generalMatrix"), "TsparseMatrix").

Maybe the ANY->xyzMatrix methods could even be generated programmatically?

Best,

H.

Subject: [Rd] Bug report: parLapply with capture.output(type="message")
 produces an error
Message-ID: <CAPLMX9Ey2=3p9C=5nsSyOQjJjz5oWherbSJ3+VO72WHLjSY7kw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, I have tested this on a fresh ubuntu image with R 4.3.1.

Rscript -e 'library(parallel)
cl = makeCluster(2)
x = parLapply(cl, 1:100, function(i) {
  capture.output(message("hello"), type = "message")
})
print("bye")'

This produces the following output:

[1] "bye"
Error in unserialize(node$con) : error reading from connection
Calls: <Anonymous> ... doTryCatch -> recvData -> recvData.SOCKnode ->
unserialize
Execution halted
Error in unserialize(node$con) : error reading from connection
Calls: <Anonymous> ... doTryCatch -> recvData -> recvData.SOCKnode ->

Execution halted

The error does not occur interactively or if stopCluster gets called at the
end.

This is actually not a bug. If we really want to identify a bug, then
it's actually a bug in your code. We'll get to that at the very end.
Either way, it's an interesting report that reveals a lot of things.

First, here's a slightly simpler version of your example:

$ Rscript --vanilla -e 'library(parallel); cl <- makeCluster(1); x <-
clusterEvalQ(cl, { capture.output(NULL, type = "message") })'
Error in unserialize(node$con) : error reading from connection
Calls: <Anonymous> ... doTryCatch -> recvData -> recvData.SOCKnode ->
unserialize
Execution halted

There are lots of things going on here, but before we get to the
answer, the most important take-home message here is:

 Never ever use capture.output(..., type = "message") in R.

Second comment is:

 No, really, do not do that!

Now, towards what is going on in your example. First, I don't think
help("capture.output") is too "kind" here, when it says:

'Messages sent to stderr() (including those from message, warning and
stop) are captured by type = "message". Note that this can be ?unsafe?
and should only be used with care.'

To understand why you shouldn't do this, you have to know that
capture.output() uses sink() internally, and its help page says:

"Sink-ing the messages stream should be done only with great care. For
that stream file must be an already open connection, and there is no
stack of connections."

The "[When] Sink-ing the messages stream ... there is no stack of
connections" is the reason for your the problem you're experiencing.
What happens is that, the background workers that you launch with
parallel::makeCluster() will use sink(..., type = "message")
internally and that's active throughout all parallel evaluation.  Now,
when you add another one of, via your capture.output(..., type =
"message"), you are stealing the "message" sink from the parallel
worker.  Our simplified example can be reproduced using only sink():s
as:

$ Rscript --vanilla -e 'library(parallel); cl <- makeCluster(1); x <-
clusterEvalQ(cl, { sink(file(nullfile(), open = "a"), type =
"message"); sink(type = "message") })'
Error in unserialize(node$con) : error reading from connection
Calls: <Anonymous> ... doTryCatch -> recvData -> recvData.SOCKnode ->
unserialize
Execution halted

Back to the "message" sink that parallel sets up. By default, it sinks
to the "null" file.  This is done to avoid output on parallel workers
from cluttering up the terminal.  The default is controlled by
argument 'outfile' of makeCluster(), i.e. our example does:

cl <- makeCluster(1, outfile = "/dev/null")

Now, since we're stealing the "message" sink from the worker when we
call sink(..., type = "message") on the parallel worker, any output on
the workers is no longer sent to the "null" file, but instead straight
out to the terminal. So, after stealing the sink, we're effectively
running as if we had told the parallel workers to not sink output.  We
can manually do this by:

cl <- makeCluster(1, outfile = "")

We're almost there.  If we use the latter, we will see all output from
the parallel worker(s).  Let's try that:

$ Rscript --vanilla -e 'library(parallel); cl <- makeCluster(1,
outfile = ""); x <- clusterEvalQ(cl, { })'
starting worker pid=349252 on localhost:11036 at 17:45:05.125
Error in unserialize(node$con) : error reading from connection
Calls: <Anonymous> ... doTryCatch -> recvData -> recvData.SOCKnode ->
unserialize
Execution halted

You see. There's a "starting worker ..." output that we now see.  But
more importantly, we now also see that "error reading from connection"
message.  So, as you see, that error message is there regardless of us
capturing or sinking the "message" output.  Instead, what it tells us
is that there is an error taking place at the very end, but we
normally don't see it.

This error is because when the main R session shuts down, the parallel
workers are still running and trying to listen to the socket
connection that they use to communicate with the main R session.  But
that is now broken, so each parallel worker will fail when it tries to
communicate.

How to fix it? Make sure to close the 'cl' cluster before exiting the
main R session, i.e.

$ Rscript --vanilla -e 'library(parallel); cl <- makeCluster(1,
outfile = ""); x <- clusterEvalQ(cl, { }); stopCluster(cl)'
starting worker pid=349703 on localhost:11011 at 17:50:20.357

The error is no longer there, because the main R session will tell the
parallel workers to shut down *before* terminating itself. This means
there are no stray parallel workers trying to reach a non-existing
main R session.

In a way, your example revealed that you forgot to call
stopCluster(cl) at the end.

But, the real message here is: Do not mess with the "message" output in R!

I'll take the moment to rant about this: I think sink(..., type =
"message") should not be part of the public R API; it's simply
impossible to use safely, because there is no one owner controlling
it. To prevent it being used by mistake, at least it could throw an
error if there's already an active "message" sink.  Oh, well ...


Almost finally, do what you're probably trying to achieve here, when you call:

 out <- capture.output({ message("hello"); message("world") }, type = "message")

What you really want to do is:

capture_messages <- function(expr, envir = parent.frame()) {
  msgs <- list()
  withCallingHandlers({
    eval(expr, envir = envir)
  }, message = function(m) {
    msgs <<- c(msgs, list(m))
    invokeRestart("muffleMessage")
  })
  msgs
}

msgs <- capture_messages({ message("hello"); message("world") })

When you capture 'message' conditions this way, you can decide to
resignal then later, e.g.

> void <- lapply(msgs, message)
hello
world

You can capture 'warning' conditions in the same way.



Finally, if you've got to this because you wanted to
capture/see/display/view output that is taking place on parallel
workers, I recommend using the Futureverse (https://futureverse.org)
for parallelization. Disclaimer, I'm the author.  The Futureverse
takes care of relaying stdout, messages, warnings, errors, and other
types of conditions automatically. Here's an example that resembles
your original example:

> cl <- parallel::makeCluster(2)
> future::plan("cluster", workers = cl)
> y <- future.apply::future_lapply(1:3, function(i) message("hello"))
hello
hello
hello
> parallel::stopCluster(cl)

Note that those "hello" messages are truly relayed versions of the
original 'message' conditions. Warnings works the same way.

A cleaner and slightly better version of the above example is:

> library(future.apply)
> plan(multisession, workers = 2)
> y <- future.apply::future_lapply(1:3, function(i) message("hello"))
hello
hello
hello
> plan(sequential)

Over and out,

Henrik

Hi Henrik,

Thanks for the detailed technical explanation! I ended up using the
withCallingHandlers solution to achieve what I needed (thanks to stack
overflow). If this is not technically a bug I think it is unintuitive and
unexpected behavior from a user perspective. So take this as a feature
request rather than a bug report.

The error message at the end of the script doesn't inform the user what
part of the script is wrong (using sink or capture.output in parallel). It
is difficult to understand what's going on.

The "correct" solution using withCallingHandlers is esoteric, and I think
most users would not code that up naturally much less understand what it is
doing. Could capture.output(type="messages") be rewritten using this
approach?

Lastly, the help file for stopCluster says

"the workers will terminate themselves once the socket on which they are
listening for commands becomes unavailable, which it should if the master R
session is completed"

To me, this implies that I shouldn't need to call stopCluster and that the
workers are automatically stopped at the end. The place where I first saw
the error was using future_lapply and following the vignette there's no
call to stopCluster there either.

Best,
Travers

Hi Travers,

This is an implementation detail for background workers in general, in that there must be some robust way for them to exit (either upon a signal from the main session, or if the main session ends / socket disconnects). As these are background workers, their error messages are usually not seen, and hence it has been deemed good enough that they exit in this case through error. However, you do see them in your case as you have diverted the message stream as Henrik has highlighted. This may be inconvenient, but can safely be ignored.

If however, clean output is important in your use case, there is a new solution that has only just become available. This is a direct outcome of the R Project Sprint in Warwick from a month ago ? Luke Tierney has actually opened up the `parallel` package to allow other packages to provide alternative communications backends. Only possible with R-devel, but as of yesterday a new version of the `mirai` package was released to CRAN that provides one such backend.  

You would simply replace your `makeCluster()` call with `mirai::make_cluster()`. That?s the only change.

As this is the R-devel mailing list, I will not go into the details of this particular implementation, but it seems useful for users of `parallel` to know that this is now possible. As author of `mirai`, please reach out directly with questions on the package rather than replying on the list.

I just want to highlight one other possibility - if you remove `capture.output()` in your evaluation and call `mirai::make_cluster(2, output = TRUE)` instead, you will then be able to see all the messages from the background workers in your main process. It?s probably not what you?re after, but just in case.

Thanks,

Charlie

Subject: [Rd] FR: valid_regex() to test string validity as a regular
 expression
Message-ID: <CAD7Bkx9pEH78_1pUk172f4JZuLVcAgjpegVG8VE8r=5+doE-Zw@mail.gmail.com>

It will be useful to package authors trying to validate input which is
supposed to be a valid regular expression.

As near as I can tell, the only way we can do so now is to run any
regex function and check for the warning and/or condition to bubble
up:

valid_regex <- function(str) {
  stopifnot(is.character(str), length(str) == 1L)
  !inherits(tryCatch(grepl(str, ""), condition = identity), "condition")
}

That's pretty hefty/inscrutable for such a simple validation. I see a
variety of similar approaches in CRAN packages [1], all slightly
different. It would be good for R to expose a "canonical" way to run
this validation.

At root, the problem is that R does not expose the regex compilation
routines like 'tre_regcomp', so from the R side we have to resort to
hacky approaches.

Things get slightly complicated by encoding/useBytes modes
(tre_regwcomp, tre_regncomp, tre_regwncomp, tre_regcompb,
tre_regncompb; all in tre.h), but all are already present in other
regex routines, so this is doable.

Exposing a function to compile regular expressions is common in other
languages, e.g. Go [2], Python [3], JavaScript [4].

I think currently we do as.character(str) (or some equivalent), so the 
test shouldn't require str to be a character to start.  For example, 
this is currently valid code:

   grepl(1, "abc123")

It's not great style, but shouldn't generate an error.

Hi Michael,

I don't think you need compilation functions for that. If a regular 
expression is found invalid by a specific third party library R uses, 
the library should return and error to R and R should return an error to 
you, and you should probably propagate that to your users. Grepping an 
empty string might work in many cases as a test, but it is probably more 
portable to simply be prepared to propagate such errors from the actual 
use on real inputs. In theory, there could be some optimization for a 
particular case, the checking may not be the same - but that is the same 
say for compilation and checking.

Re encodings, simply R strings should be valid in their encoding. This 
is not just for regular expressions but also for anything else. You 
shouldn't assume that R can handle invalid strings in any reasonable 
way. Definitely you shouldn't try adding invalid strings in tests - 
behavior with invalid strings is unspecified. To test whether a string 
is valid, there is validEnc() (or validUTF8()). But, again, it is 
probably safest to propagate errors from the regular expression R 
functions (in case the checks differ, particularly for non-UTF-8), also, 
duplicating the encoding checks can be a non-trivial overhead.

If there was a strong need to have an automated way to somehow classify 
specifically errors from the regex libraries, perhaps R could attach 
some classes to them when the library tells.

Hello,

Could the documentation page for subset gain an example of how to use it for something other than a data frame or matrix? I arrived at

named integer(0)

I expected a part of the table to be returned rather than an empty vector.

Hello,

If you want to subset then you must refer to a variable in the original 
data set. In your example there is no 'x' in the output of table.


set.seed(2023)
random <- LETTERS[rpois(100, 10)]
(tbl <- table(random))
#> random
#>  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  J  K  L  M  N  P  Q  S
#>  1  2  4  4  8 13 14 10 17  9 11  2  1  3  1

subset(tbl, tbl > 10)
#> random
#>  H  I  K  M
#> 13 14 17 11


So it is subsetting vector data as wanted.
It is your expectation that a part of the table should be returned that 
is not in agreement with the data you have.

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

That's precisely why a base R offering is important, as a surer way of
validating in all cases. To be clear I am trying to directly access the
results of tre_regcomp().

> it is probably more portable to simply be prepared to propagate such
errors from the actual use on real inputs

That works best in self-contained calls -- foo(re) and we execute re inside
foo().

But the specific context where I found myself looking for a regex validator
is more complicated (https://github.com/r-lib/lintr/pull/2225). User
supplies a regular expression in a configuration file, only "later" is it
actually supplied to grepl().

Till now, we've done your suggestion -- just surface the regex error at run
time. But our goal is to make it friendlier and fail earlier at "compile
time" as the config is loaded, "long" before any regex is actually executed.

At a bare minimum this is a good place to return a classed warning (say
invalid_regex_warning) to allow finer control than tryCatch(condition=).

References: <mailman.53774.3.1695895202.51578.r-devel@r-project.org>

I agree that the "R Installation and Administration" guide statement about FlexiBLAS needs an update. Standard R in CentOS Stream 9, which is now downstream from Fedora, gives the following result for Matrix products in sessionInfo():

> sessionInfo()
R version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16)
Platform: x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu (64-bit)
Running under: CentOS Stream 9

Matrix products: default
BLAS/LAPACK: FlexiBLAS OPENBLAS-OPENMP;  LAPACK version 3.9.0
?

So OpenBLAS compiled with OpenMP is the default. FlexiBLAS (via the flexiblas package) is my favorite way to manage core use in multithreaded BLAS computations. It is also the default in the EasyBuild foss compiler toolchain for HPC clusters: https://docs.easybuild.io/common-toolchains/ 

What would be a good way to suggest or construct an update?

Best regards,
George

Hi Michael, it sounds like you don't want to use a CRAN package for
this, but you may try re2, see below.

Error in grepl("(invalid", "subject", perl = TRUE) :
  invalid regular expression '(invalid'
In addition: Warning message:
In grepl("(invalid", "subject", perl = TRUE) :

    'missing closing parenthesis'

Error in grepl("(invalid", "subject", perl = FALSE) :
  invalid regular expression '(invalid', reason 'Missing ')''
In addition: Warning message:

Great to know this exists in package space!

Of course, using re2 validation for a regex to be executed with TRE
(via grep*) is just begging for trouble (e.g. [1] suggests re2 is
closer to PCRE, [2] says "mostly" PCRE compatible). And overhauling
everything to use re2 just for regex validation is hardly practical.

Note that I also am an *occasional* happy user of FlexiBLAS (the
Fedora package *and* the corresponding CRAN package
'flexiblas'), using regular Fedora Linux,
*and* am happy to give public thanks for both to  I?aki ?car
(and whoever has helped with the project).

Thank you, George, for the offering of an update;  to answer the question

Create a patch to the *source* of that manual which is written
in "texinfo".
It is part of R's sources, the latest version hence is always

   https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/doc/manual/R-admin.texi

  (or "almost always current" at one of its github mirrors ..)

Best regards,
Martin
