Given that optim()seems to have problem with denormals but work correctly with values greater than 1e-308, I think that it can hardly be considered a real bug.

There is no miracle solution, but there are a few tricks to work with extreme values.
What I call "flogs" are alternative representation of a number x as log(abs(x)) and sign(x). It supports very large and very small numbers, but the precision of flogs is very poor for very large numbers. Functions for addition, substraction, multiplication, etc, can easily be written.

For values that are between 0 and 1 and can be extremely close to 0 or extremely close to 1, a cloglog transformations can be used.

Another trick is to detect "hot points". Values that can be extremely close to hot points should be expressed as differences to the hot point, and the algorithm should be re-written to work with that, which is not always easy to do. For instance, the function log1p can be seen as a modification of the log function when the hot point is 1. 

In my experience, the algorithm should be rewritten before having to deal with denormals, because denormals expand the range of floating point values by a quite small amount.

Message-ID: <8e91fa86638d4ee98d6a3b0477b020bf@UM-MAIL3213.unimaas.nl>

Hi all,

Not sure if this is of interest to anybody, but with the help of some kind folks over at the #haiku channel on IRC, I finally got the current version of R to compile under the Haiku operating system (https://www.haiku-os.org):

https://scholar.social/@wviechtb/109627078225954444

Kate (https://kate-editor.org) makes for a workable IDE allowing for REPL-like interactivity. X11 support is lacking, so graphs are directly created as pdfs, but this is workable.

In case you want to give this a try, it's pretty much this:

pkgman install gcc_fortran bzip2_devel lrzip_devel xz_utils_devel libpcre2_devel libiconv_devel curl_devel readline_devel tiff4_devel libtool ncurses6_devel libpaper_devel lapack_devel tcl_devel xcairo_devel pangomm_devel

wget https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-4/R-4.2.2.tar.gz

tar -xzf R-4.2.2.tar.gz
cd R-4.2.2

export CPPFLAGS="-D_BSD_SOURCE"
export LIBS="-lnetwork -lbsd"

./configure --with-x=no --disable-java --enable-R-shlib --prefix=/boot/home/<wherever>
make
make install

thank you very much,  use R on haiku-os several times before. the OS is fast and eye-candy, just release beta 4 before new year.
when use R on haiku-os, some package will compiled failed(cairo for example) ,but most package work seamlessly.

btw, about R on haiku-os , Maybe you could create a git push on haikuports?

Dear developers,

for those building from source on Windows:

A new toolchain called "RTools43" has been prepared by Tomas Kalibera.
It is now used to build the Windows binaries (R base and contributed 
packages) for R-devel on Windows. See

Message-ID: <ba02397f-c3f1-bb53-18c8-31aa91f498c2@gmail.com>

I'm in the process of a fairly large overhaul of the exports from the 
rgl package, with an aim of simplifying maintenance of the package. 
During this work, I came across the reverse dependency geomorph that 
calls the rgl.primitive function.

I had forgotten that rgl.primitive was still exported:  I've been 
thinking of it as an internal function for a few years now.  I was 
surprised geomorph was able to call it.

Particularly surprising to me was the fact that it is not properly 
documented.  One of the help topics lists it as an alias, but it 
contains no usage info, and is not mentioned in the .Rd file other than 
the alias.  And yet "R CMD check rgl" has never complained about it.

Is this intentional?

Does the Rd file that documents it have \keyword{internal}? These are
not checked fully (as I realized recently while working on the help
system), and I guess that's intentional.

Message-ID: <TYAP286MB0268B510AA1D33E61F7A39A7D1FB9@TYAP286MB0268.JPNP286.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Last week ,I report a issuse about  timezone name about" China Standard Time", R on windows will report to Asia/Taipei , but it should be Asia/Shanghai,
Since  still now  no feedback (maybe because for my poor english). So resubmit a patch about this .

Change it from Asia/Taipei to Asia/Shanghai could veryfied from
1  tzutil (this is windows buildin command  made by microsoft )  , run tzutil /l , it show  " China Standard Time" is (UTC+08:00) Beijing, Chongqing, Hong Kong, Urumqi  (AKA Asia/Shanghai on linux)? and furthermore , tzutil /l also report   Taipei Standard Time (Asia/Taipei) , so Sys.timezone() report  " China Standard Time" to Asia/Taipei indeed uncorrect.

2  timezone and their definition on window could found on microsoft website
   https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/default-time-zones?view=windows-10

   in this document , it also show " China Standard Time" is (UTC+08:00) Beijing, Chongqing, Hong Kong, Urumqi  (AKA Asia/Shanghai on linux) ,

3  also in unicode org web , the lastest document about time also support this patch
https://unicode-org.github.io/cldr-staging/charts/42/supplemental/zone_tzid.html

  China Standard Time   Asia/Shanghai

and in current R implemention , it report " China Standard Time" is incorrect ,but "Taipei Standard Time" is correct, so this patch only need modify " China Standard Time" and will not affect other timezone.

please feel free to share your thoughts or feedbacks of this patch

Sometimes, everyone is too busy to discuss a patch right now, but a
patch just left on R-devel may be eventually forgotten before there's
time for discussion. Try asking for a Bugzilla account (by following

Thank you for verifying this. As far as I can tell, the file has always
contained both entries referring to "Asia/Taipei":

No, not marked internal.  Here's a simple example:  a package that 
exports f and g, and has only one help page:

---------------------
NAMESPACE:
---------------------
export(f, g)
---------------------

---------------------
R/source.R:
---------------------
f <- function() "this is f"

g <- function() "this is g"
---------------------

---------------------
man/f.Rd:
---------------------
\name{f}
\alias{f}
\alias{g}
\title{
This is f.
}
\description{
This does nothing
}
\usage{
f()
}
---------------------


No complaints about the lack of documentation of g.

I am fairly certain that the check for documentation is really just a check
for the presence of the function name in an "alias" line. My circumstantial
evidence, from a package in the early stages of development, came from
changing the name of a function. I updated everything else (usage,
examples, etc.) but forgot to change the alias. Got a warning that the
newly named function was not documented. It took me a while to figure out
why R CMD check was still complaining.

I am also pretty sure that, when looking for help in at least one existing
package (can't remember which one), I clicked on the link and got sent to a
page that said absolutely nothing about the function I was interested in.

Yes, that's what the test does, and that's fine.  The problem is with 
the usage test in tools::codoc().  If I had incorrect arguments 
specified for a documented function, I'd be warned.  If I skip the usage 
docs completely, I am not warned.	

I think the test belongs around here in the source:

https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/blob/b57918fd104962415a752ea7db12dcf4f3f5219f/src/library/tools/R/QC.R#L585

If you look there, you see a variable named 
"functions_in_usages_not_in_code" but nothing named 
"functions_in_code_not_in_usages".

 patch about timezone name of China Standard Time  on windows

Just a quick comment here - this is not as easy as it sounds, because the code is in the "extra" directory which means it is based on upstream sources, so those sources are typically not patched manually as it would be hard to apply upstream updates. In this case the standards have changed since the last update, so the way to go about this would be to upgrade according to latest sources and standards as it's quite possible that the issue has been addressed there. However, such update is quite time-consuming process as we have to make sure that the standards are matched and changes have not broken something in R. So you can file an issue so this is on record, but I wouldn't include patches since they cannot be applied directly for reasons explained as it has to be done as a part of the full update, not just a single entry.

Cheers,
Simon

understand your concerns.
for registerTZ.c itself , IMHO , the most important part is the definition of tztable[] .  which come form http://unicode.org/cldr/data/diff/supplemental/windows_tzid.html ,but it can??t access now, the lasted version is https://unicode-org.github.io/cldr-staging/charts/42/supplemental/zone_tzid.html.

maybe  we need write a script  or small tools  , use it sync with unicode standard and microsoft registery or tzutil , to generate tztable definition?
will this better than current way? if it is i
will try it in next 1-2 weeks.

best regards
Yu Gong

Subject: [Rd] Looking for R for Windows (rversion: 4.2.2) in
 base/old/%rversion%/R-%rversion%-win.exe
Message-ID: <SA1PR14MB464299BE2DB514FB72367D069CF99@SA1PR14MB4642.namprd14.prod.outlook.com>

Peter Dalgaard, R-devel team, et al.,

Hi, my name is Andre Mikulec.

I am an `common` committer to Postgres PL/R . . .
https://github.com/postgres-plr/plr/commits?author=AndreMikulec

https://github.com/postgres-plr/plr
`PL/R - PostgreSQL support for R as a procedural language (PL)`

However, now and different from the past,
the `windows/base/old` R 4.2.2 download location URL link now, redirects to the wrong `R 4.2.1` location.

Historically,
Previous and Current(still called `old`) Windows versions of R
have been stored here (below) and the current(old) version of R would have been 4.2.2. and would have pointed to R 4.2.2.

https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/

```
In this directory (and its URL redirect (->)):
R 4.2.2 (October, 2022) -> https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/4.2.1 (NEED 4.2.2)
R 4.2.1 (June, 2022) -> https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/4.2.1/
```

So, something has changed `R 4.2.2 (October, 2022)` now redirects to `base/old/4.2.1`.

Now and in the past, Appveyor builds of PL/R rely a specific version of R in an exact location:

https://github.com/postgres-plr/plr/blob/4ac054e61c62f72a9cd3a38f66476d037b3e27a5/appveyor.yml#L25
```
 - pg: REL_15_0
    PlatformToolset: v141
    configuration: Release
    APPVEYOR_BUILD_WORKER_IMAGE: Visual Studio 2017
    rversion: 4.2.1
```

Notice (above and) below the variable `rversion: 4.2.1`
and the hard coded location `base/old/%rversion%/R-%rversion%-win.exe`.

https://github.com/postgres-plr/plr/blob/4ac054e61c62f72a9cd3a38f66476d037b3e27a5/appveyor.yml#L108
```
- if not exist R-%rversion%-win.exe appveyor downloadfile https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/%rversion%/R-%rversion%-win.exe
```

E.g. the most recent PL/R build (a month ago) using R 4.2.1
`PL/R - PostgreSQL support for R as a procedural language (PL)` build:

https://ci.appveyor.com/project/davecramer/plr-daun5/build/job/7lqs9pkgartjhxwt?fullLog=true#L15
```
Cache 'R-4.2.1-win.exe' - Restored
Running Install scripts
if not exist R-%rversion%-win.exe appveyor downloadfile https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/%rversion%/R-%rversion%-win.exe
R-%rversion%-win.exe /VERYSILENT
```

Now, where may One find a `specific version of R in an exact location`?

Please help.

Thanks,
Andre Mikulec

Dunno what happened there, and Win binaries are generally "not my table". However, 4.2.2 is not old, so possibly should not be on that list at all. It is the current version, so can be obtained via the "here" link at the top of the page (i.e. https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)

Actually, IIuc the infrastructure is there, but it is not used.
print.codoc() has

    ## In general, functions in the code which only have an \alias but
    ## no \usage entry are not necessarily a problem---they might be
    ## mentioned in other parts of the Rd object documenting them, or be
    ## 'internal'.  However, if a package has a namespace, then all
    ## *exported* functions should have \usage entries (apart from
    ## defunct functions and S4 generics, see the above comments for
    ## functions_missing_from_usages).  Currently, this information is
    ## returned in the codoc object but not shown.  Eventually, we might
    ## add something like
    ##     functions_missing_from_usages <-
    ##         attr(x, "functions_missing_from_usages")
    ##     if(length(functions_missing_from_usages)) {
    ##         writeLines("Exported functions without usage information:")
    ##         .pretty_print(functions_in_code_not_in_usages)
    ##         writeLines("")
    ##     }
    ## similar to the above.

which goes back to sometimes 2009 ...

I'm not sure how simple it would be to script this since others have been working on this, but if it was doable it would be a good start. There are others that know more about CLDR than I do.

Search and read some information about windows timezone to Linux timezone mapping this week.
 And found an .net library implement this, https://github.com/mattjohnsonpint/TimeZoneConverter . Question is how to use it?
