Hi Martin, Thank you for your reply. The response and the links provided by
you helped to learn more. But I am not able to obtain the simple even
powers of a matrix: one simple case is the square of a matrix. The square
of the matrix using direct matrix multiplication operations and svd (A = U
D V') are different. Kindly check the attached file for the complete
explanation. I want to know which technique was used in building the svd in
R-Software. I want to discuss about svd if you schedule a meeting.

Thanks and Regards
Durga Prasad

Hi Durga,

There?s an error in your calculations here. You mention that for the SVD of a symmetric matrix, we must have U=V, but this is not a correct statement. The unitary matrices are only equivalent if the matrix A is positive semidefinite.

In your example, you provide the matrix {{1,4},{4,1}}, which has eigenvalues 5 and -3. This is not positive semidefinite, and thus there's no requirement that the unitary matrices be equivalent.

If you verify your example with something like wolfram alpha, you?ll find that R?s solution is correct.

Dear all,

I have used optim a lot in contexts where it would useful to be able to iterate function myfun that, in addition to the primary objective to be minimized ('minimize.me'), could return other values such as alternative metrics of the minimization, informative intermediate values from the calculations, etc.

myfun  <- function()
{
...
return(list(minimize.me = minimize.me, R2 = R2, pval = pval, etc.))
}

During the iteration, optim could utilize just the first value from the myfun return list; all the other values calculated and returned by myfun could be ignored by optim.
After convergence, the other return values of myfun could be finally extracted and appended into the optim return value (which is a list) as additional entry e.g.: $aux <- list(R2, pval, etc.), (without 'minimize.me' as it is already returned as $value).

The usual ways for accessing optim return values, e.g., $par, $value, etc. are not affected.  Computational cost may not be prohibitive either.  Is this feasible to consider?

If you only wish to store additional information, you could do
so with an environment, without changing optim.  For instance,
like so (using the first example from ?optim):

    data <- new.env()
    data$i <- 0
    data$fun.value <- numeric(1000)
    
    fr <- function(x, data) {   ## Rosenbrock Banana function
        x1 <- x[1]
        x2 <- x[2]
        ans <- 100 * (x2 - x1 * x1)^2 + (1 - x1)^2
        data$i <- data$i + 1
        data$fun.value[data$i] <- ans
        ans
    }
    optim(c(-1.2,1), fr, data = data)
    ## $par
    ## [1] 1.000260 1.000506
    ## 
    ## $value
    ## [1] 8.825241e-08
    ## 
    ## $counts
    ## function gradient 
    ##      195       NA 
    ## 
    ## ....

    data$i
    ## 195
    
    plot(data$fun.value[1:data$i])

Enrico gave you a workaround that stores the extra values in an environment.

Another possible workaround is an optional argument to myfun() that asks 
it to return more information, e.g.

     fr <- function(x, data, extraInfo = FALSE) {   ## Rosenbrock Banana 
function
         x1 <- x[1]
         x2 <- x[2]
         ans <- 100 * (x2 - x1 * x1)^2 + (1 - x1)^2
         if (extraInfo) {
           list(ans=ans, extras = ...)
         else
           ans
     }

Then after optim() finishes, call fr() again with parameters as returned 
by optim, and extraInfo = TRUE.

 feature request: optim() iteration of functions that return

For a solution that does not require any change to the original function 
being optimized, the following one-liner could be used, which converts 
existing functions to functions that return only the first element:

returnFirst <- function(fun) function(...) do.call(fun,list(...))[[1]]

Example:

fr <- function(x) {   ## Rosenbrock Banana function
   x1 <- x[1]
   x2 <- x[2]
   ans <- 100 * (x2 - x1 * x1)^2 + (1 - x1)^2
   list(ans=ans, extra1 = 1:10, extra2 = letters)
}

fr2 <- returnFirst(fr)
tmp <- optim(c(-1.2,1), fr2)
fr(tmp$par)

These sound like error codes returned from the operating system, which
R has no choice but forward to the user. (Well, in this case the error
turns out to be transient, but files are unfortunately fraught with
peril with no easy solutions [*].)

Even using system call tracing or setting a symbolic debugger breakpoint
on an error return from cat() will only tell you the OS error code and
the file on which the operation failed, both of which you already know.
Getting to the root of the problem will likely involve drilling down
into the details of the exact networked filesystem used, which R is
supposed to know nothing about. Maybe you could ask on ServerFault or
on #linux / #windows / #<applicable server OS> on Libera.Char?

Subject: [Rd] HTML documentation check works best with Tidy >= 5.0.0
Message-ID: <20230805235255.71a4cdb7@parabola>

Hello R-devel,

Old versions of HTML Tidy report false positive NOTEs for the HTML
verison of the manual where Tidy encounters HTML5 features it is not
ready for.

Conveniently, both HTML5 support and release version numbers officially
appeared in HTML Tidy version 5.0.0 [*]. For example, the last version
of the "old Tidy" I could find fails on an R help page:

 cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous at tidy.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/tidy \
  co -P tidy
 cd tidy
 make -C build/gmake
 bin/tidy -v

 # line 44 column 1 - Warning: <table> lacks "summary" attribute
 # line 200 column 1 - Warning: <table> lacks "summary" attribute
 # <...>

On the other hand, the oldest released version of the Tidy-HTML5 handles
Rd-produced HTML correctly:

 git clone https://github.com/htacg/tidy-html5
 cd tidy-html5
 git checkout 5.0.0
 mkdir b5.0.0
 cd b5.0.0
 cmake ..
 cmake --build .
 ./tidy -v

  ./tidy >/dev/null
 # Info: Document content looks like HTML5
 # No warnings or errors were found.

We can use this information to only use HTML Tidy versions that support
the idioms used by Rd2HTML:

Message-ID: <CAMMJQ0b-AwgT-3U-4TQYwLA7+NPzj8E0Y2Q=xXk6KWOgCJqUjg@mail.gmail.com>

Sorry if this topic has been discussed earlier.

Currently, hist(..., log="y") fails with

> hist(rexp(1000, 1), log="y")
Warning messages:
1: In plot.window(xlim, ylim, "", ...) :
  nonfinite axis=2 limits [GScale(-inf,2.59218,..); log=TRUE] -- corrected
now
2: In title(main = main, sub = sub, xlab = xlab, ylab = ylab, ...) :
  "log" is not a graphical parameter
3: In axis(1, ...) : "log" is not a graphical parameter
4: In axis(2, at = yt, ...) : "log" is not a graphical parameter

The same applies for log="x"

> hist(rexp(1000, 1), log="x")
Warning messages:
1: In plot.window(xlim, ylim, "", ...) :
  nonfinite axis=1 limits [GScale(-inf,0.954243,..); log=TRUE] -- corrected
now
2: In title(main = main, sub = sub, xlab = xlab, ylab = ylab, ...) :
  "log" is not a graphical parameter
3: In axis(1, ...) : "log" is not a graphical parameter
4: In axis(2, at = yt, ...) : "log" is not a graphical parameter

This applies for the current svn version of R, and also a few recent
published versions.  This is unfortunate for two reasons:

* the error message is not quite correct--"log" is a graphical parameter,
but "hist" does not support it.
* for various kinds of data it is worthwhile to make histograms in log
scale.  "hist" is a very nice and convenient function and support for log
scale would be handy here.

I also played a little with the code, and it seems to be very easy to
implement.  I am happy to make a  patch if the team thinks it is worth
pursuing.

Cheers,
Ott

I have done this using attributes:

fr <- function(x) {   ## Rosenbrock Banana function
   x1 <- x[1]
   x2 <- x[2]
   ans <- 100 * (x2 - x1 * x1)^2 + (1 - x1)^2
   attr(ans, "extra1") <- 1:10
   attr(ans, "extra2") <- letters
   ans
}

Not sure if this works in your case though.

Ott

I've checked the "modern" Windows binaries of HTML Tidy, and they say
so too. Cannot check the macOS version easily.

I think that any released version older than 5.0.0 (before the
development moved from https://tidy.sf.net/ to
https://www.html-tidy.org/ in 2015) will only identify itself by the
release date. Judging by an R-SIG-Mac thread I've found, "Apple Inc.
build 2649" that may be bundled with some macOS versions must be of the
SourceForge vintage too, before they started using version numbers.

There are commits in the "modern" Tidy source tree using 4.x.x version
numbers, but I don't think they were considered to be formally
released. For example, Debian went from the SourceForge CVS snapshots
straight to 5.2.0 in 2016 without packaging the 4.x.x versions.

hist() is designed so that the total area sums to 1. You should build you desired behavior using a barchart.

I guess my memory was off slightly. Densities are only plotted with freq=TRUE. Still there the ever present conundrum that 0 counts cannot be sensibly represented. 

Why not:
hist( log(x), ?) #? In situations where it might make sense.

Subject: [Rd] A demonstrated shortcoming of the R package management system
Message-ID: <25808.2815.112074.192190@rob.eddelbuettel.com>


CRAN, by relying on the powerful package management system that is part of R,
provides an unparalleled framework for extending R with nearly 20k packages.

We recently encountered an issue that highlights a missing element in the
otherwise outstanding package management system. So we would like to start a
discussion about enhancing its feature set. As shown below, a mechanism to
force reinstallation of packages may be needed.

A demo is included below, it is reproducible in a container. We find the
easiest/fastest reproduction is by saving the code snippet below in the
current directory as eg 'matrixIssue.R' and have it run in a container as

   docker run --rm -ti -v `pwd`:/mnt rocker/r2u Rscript /mnt/matrixIssue.R
  
This runs in under two minutes, first installing the older Matrix, next
installs SeuratObject, and then by removing the older Matrix making the
(already installed) current Matrix version the default. This simulates a
package update for Matrix. Which, as the final snippet demonstrates, silently
breaks SeuratObject as the cached S4 method Csparse_validate is now missing.
So when SeuratObject was installed under Matrix 1.5.1, it becomes unuseable
under Matrix 1.6.0.

What this shows is that a call to update.packages() will silently corrupt an
existing installation.  We understand that this was known and addressed at
CRAN by rebuilding all binary packages (for macOS and Windows).

But it leaves both users relying on source installation as well as
distributors of source packages in a dire situation. It hurt me three times:
my default R installation was affected with unit tests (involving
SeuratObject) silently failing. It similarly broke our CI setup at work.  And
it created a fairly bad headache for the Debian packaging I am involved with
(and I surmise it affects other distro similarly).

It would be good to have a mechanism where a package, when being upgraded,
could flag that 'more actions are required' by the system (administrator).
We think this example demonstrates that we need such a mechanism to avoid
(silently !!) breaking existing installations, possibly by forcing
reinstallation of other packages.  R knows the package dependency graph and
could trigger this, possibly after an 'opt-in' variable the user / admin
sets.

One possibility may be to add a new (versioned) field 'Breaks:'. Matrix could
then have added 'Breaks: SeuratObject (<= 4.1.3)' preventing an installation
of Matrix 1.6.0 when SeuratObject 4.1.3 (or earlier) is present, but
permitting an update to Matrix 1.6.0 alongside a new version, say, 4.1.4 of
SeuratObject which could itself have a versioned Depends: Matrix (>= 1.6.0).

   I would support this suggestion.  There is a similar binary 
dependency chain from Matrix ? TMB ? glmmTMB; we have implemented 
various checks to make users aware that they need to reinstall from 
source, and to some extent we've tried to push out synchronous updates 
(i.e., push an update of TMB to CRAN every time Matrix changes, and an 
update of glmmTMB after that), but centralized machinery for this would 
certainly be nice.

   FWIW some of the machinery is here: 
https://github.com/glmmTMB/glmmTMB/blob/d9ee7b043281341429381faa19b5e53cb5a378c3/glmmTMB/R/utils.R#L209-L295 
-- it relies on a Makefile rule that caches the current installed 
version of TMB:

No, not if you use R's (or S's before that) definition:

   graphical parameters := {the possible argument of par()}

log is *not* among these.

Yes, possibly (see below).
Note that the above are not errors, but warnings,
and there *is* some support, e.g.,

    > Cheers, Ott

Yeah.. and that's is the important question.

Most statisticians know that a histogram is a pretty bad
density estimator (notably if the natural density has an
infinite support) compared to simple kernel density estimates,
e.g. those by density().
Hence, I'd argue that if you expect enough sophistication from
your "viewer"s to understand a log-scale histogram, I'd say you
should use a density with log="x" and or "y"  and I I have
successfully done so several times: It *does* work
{particularly nicely if you use my sfsmisc::eaxis() for the log axis/es}.

But you (and others) may have more good arguments why hist()
should work with log="x" and/or log="y"...

Also if your patch relatively small, its usefulness may 
outweigh the added complexity (and its long-term maintenance !).

Subject: [Rd] Detecting physical CPUs in detectCores() on Linux platforms
Message-ID: <CAObhMffcPOLHN_ko1VQEu-taHjCiuc5kPCA9ybS1O9r_UOn1GQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I recently noticed that `detectCores()` ignores the `logical=FALSE`
argument on Linux platforms. This means that the function will always
return the number of logical CPUs, i.e. it will count the number of threads
that theoretically can run in parallel due to e.g. hyper-threading.
Unfortunately, this can result in issues in high-performance computing use
cases where hyper-threading might degrade performance instead of improving
it.

Currently, src/library/parallel/R/detectCores.R uses the following R/shell
code fragment to identify the number of logical CPUs:
linux = 'grep "^processor" /proc/cpuinfo 2>/dev/null | wc -l'

As far as I understand, one could derive the number of online physical CPUs
by parsing the contents of /sys/devices/system/cpu/* but that seems rather
cumbersome. Instead, could we amend the R code with the following line?
linux = if(logical) 'grep "^processor" /proc/cpuinfo 2>/dev/null | wc -l'
else 'lscpu -b --parse="CORE" | tail -n +5 | sort -u | wc -l'

This solution uses `lscpu` from `sys-utils`. The -b switch makes sure that
only online CPUs/cores are listed and due to the --parse="CORE", the output
will contain only a single column with logical core ids. It seems to do the
job in my view, but there might be edge cases for exotic CPU topologies
that I am not aware of.

Thank you, Nils

That's good but you also need to at protect this from `lscpu` being in the
path.  Maybe `if (logical && nzchar(Sys.which("lscpu")))` ?

I wouldn't entirely agree that Matrix 1.6.0 breaks SeuratObject 4.1.3,
given that it's still possible to install first Matrix 1.6.0 and then
SeuratObject 4.1.3. The breakage definitely exists, but not on the
source package level.

It may also not be easy for the package developer to notice breaking a
binary package while performing reverse dependency checks, in time to
add such a notice to their package. The recommended way to do that is
tools::check_packages_in_dir(), which works on source packages.

Would it help to reframe the problem in terms of binary packages
acquiring dependency constraints that are more strict than those of the
corresponding source packages? If a package that imports S4 classes
from another package and thus ends up caching their definitions, R
could compute a hash of the classes being imported, store it together
with the installed package and complain noisily if the hash doesn't
match later at load time. This could be used to detect such problems
automatically (but could also result in false positives!).

This is not the only way a binary package could accidentally depend on
internals of another binary package. I remember reading about (but
cannot find it now!) some packages "importing" a function from ggplot2
(I think) by assigning it into their namespace:

 foo <- ggplot2::useful_function

This worked for quite a while, but later broke because
ggplot2::useful_function called an internal function which ceased to
exist in a new version of ggplot2. This is arguably a bug and probably
even harder to track, but are there any other ways to catch a "binary
dependency" for a package?

Log histograms are of particular interest when dealing with heavy tailed 
data/distributions.

It is not just a matter of using a log scale on the y axis though 
because the base line of the histogram is at zero and the log of zero is 
minus infinity.

I have implemented a version of a log histogram in the function logHist, 
in my package DistributionUtils, which may be of interest if anyone 
seriously wishes to add functionality to the base hist function.

Alternatively, using only on POSIX utils which should be in the path of
all Linux Systems and /proc/cpuinfo:

awk '/^physical id/{PHYS_ID=$NF; next} /^cpu cores/{print PHYS_ID"
"$NF;}' /proc/cpuinfo 2>/dev/null | sort | uniq | awk '{sum+=$NF;} END
{print sum}'.

Parses /proc/cpuinfo for the number of physical cores and physical id
in each CPU. Only returns unique combinations of physical id (i.e.
Socket) and core numbers. Then sums up the number of cores for each
physicalid to get the total amount of physical cores.

Something I had lying around. Someone with better awk skills could
probably do sorting and filtering in awk as well to save on pipes.
Works on single and multisocket AMD/Intel from my experience.

Two quite related and recent threads on R-devel:

[1] proposal for WRE: clarify that use of S4 classes implies use of superclasses
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2023-July/082739.html
[2] Should package version requirements assume installation from sources?
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2022-September/081971.html

Notably, if SeuratObject 4.1.3, the current version, had

     importClassesFrom(Matrix, dgCMatrix,
                       ## and the exported superclasses:
                       CsparseMatrix, Matrix, compMatrix, dMatrix,
                       dsparseMatrix, generalMatrix, sparseMatrix)

and not just

     importClassesFrom(Matrix, dgCMatrix)

then the silent breakage due to missing symbols would not have occurred.
That is because _imported_ class definitions are retrieved at load time,
not at install time.  SeuratObject 4.1.3 retrieves the CsparseMatrix
definition at install time, so indeed it is liable to become stale with
Matrix updates ...

Not to derail Dirk's proposal for "Breaks", which could certainly have
uses beyond this particular example where a "correct" NAMESPACE directive
would solve the problems ...

Hi Ivan,

I usually 'mentally applaud' when reading your replies on list but not here.

You seem to overlook that a large part of the R Universe only works off
source distributions and, as one cannot run source, builds binaries off them.

The breakage is real.

Also implying our packages in question would not reverse-dependency check is
not helpful. Of course they do.

[ And as an illustrative aside, part of the 'third problem I mentioned in my
initial email concerning Debian is that eg (some) Debian maintainers insist
on autopkgtests (a good idea in theory) and get terribly hung up when they
manage to mismatch package relations (ie 'skew' from CRAN -- while that is in
part self-imposed) some troubles are real and eg Matrix 1.6.0 only got to
'testing' now after release manager intervention. (And no Mikael, that was
not Seurat related but thanks for the tip in your email, already passed it
on.)  Of course we have other issues too there with eg exotic non-CRAN
platforms (now including i386) breaking. But that is outside of this thread.
Thanks for bearing with me). ]

Subject: [Rd] Vectorize library() to improve handling of versioned deps
 [sprint project proposal]
Message-ID: <CAD4oTHHGoQ0geRoUoULpcxLnEEgnfU+ZCzubmFkUAA29Z1wGUQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

This is a proposal for a project which could be worked on during the R
development Sprint at the end of this month; it was requested that we start
a discussion here to see what R-core's thoughts on it were before we
officially add it to the docket.


AFAIK, R officially supports both versioned dependencies (almost
exclusively of the >=version variety) and library paths with more than one
directory. Further, I believe if at least de facto supports the same
package being installed in different directories along the lib path. The
most common of these, I'd bet, would be different versions of the same
library being installed in a site library and in a user's personal library,
though that's not the only way this can happen.

The combination of these two features, however can give rise to
packages which are all correctly installed and all loadable individually,
but which must be loaded in a particular order when used together or the
loading of some of them will fail.

Consider the following dependency structure between packages

pkgA: pkgB (>= 0.5.0)

pkgC: pkgB (>= 0.6.0)

Consider the following multi-libpath setup:

~/pth1/: pkgA, pkg B [0.5.1]
~/pth2/: pkg C, pkg B [0.6.5]

And consider that we have the libpath c("~/pth1/", "~/pth2").

If we do

library(pkgA)

Things will work great.

Same if we do

library(pkgC)

BUT, if we do

library(pkgA)
library(pkgC)

pkgC will not be able to be loaded, because an insufficient version of
pkgB will
already be loaded.

I propose that library be modified to be able to take a character vector of
package names, when it does, it performs the dependency calculations to
determine how all packages in the vector can be loaded (in the order they
appear). In the example above, this would mean that if we did

library(c("pkgA", "pkgC"))

It would determine that pkgB version 0.6.5 was needed (or alternatively,
that version 0.5.1 was insufficient) and use that *when loading the
dependencies of pkgA*.

The proposal issue for the sprint itself is here:
https://github.com/r-devel/r-project-sprint-2023/discussions/15

Thoughts?

First, detecting HT vs cores is not necessarily possible in general, Linux may assign core id to each HT depending on circumstances:

$ grep 'cpu cores' /proc/cpuinfo | uniq
cpu cores	: 32
$ grep 'model name' /proc/cpuinfo | uniq
model name	: Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6142 CPU @ 2.60GHz

and you can look up that Xenon 6142 has 16 cores.

Second, instead of "awk"ward contortions it's easily done in R with something like

d=read.dcf("/proc/cpuinfo")
sum(as.integer(tapply(
  d[,grep("cpu cores",colnames(d))],
  d[,grep("physical id",colnames(d))], `[`, 1)))

which avoids subprocesses, quoting hell and all such issues...

Cheers,
Simon

Love the use of read.dcf("/proc/cpuinfo") !!

On my box a simpler

I don't think that works on NUMA/SMP machines - you need to add all the cores for each CPU (that's why the above splits by physical id which is unique per cpu). On a dual-cpu machine:

> as.integer(unique(d[, grep("cpu cores",colnames(d))]))
[1] 32
> sum(as.integer(tapply(
 d[,grep("cpu cores",colnames(d))],
 d[,grep("physical id",colnames(d))], `[`, 1)))
[1] 64

Also things get quite fun on VMs as they can cobble together quite a few virtual CPUs regardless of the underlying hardware.

To be honest I think the motivation of this thread is dubious at best: it is a bad idea to use detectCore() blindly to specify parallelization and we explicitly say it's a bad idea - any sensible person will set it according to the demands, the hardware and the task. The number of cores is only partially relevant - e.g. if any I/O is involved you want to oversubscribe the CPU. If you have other users you want to only use a fraction etc. That doesn't mean that the we couldn't do a better job, but if you have to use detectCores() then you are already in trouble to start with.

Cheers,
Simon

As I often say, "life's a bitch and then you die".  Detecting hardware
capabilties at run-time is no small task.

When 1 1/2 decades ago I filled in maintaining slurm for Debian (and
interfacing open-mpi) that latter project added an entire library for that
scope (libhwloc).  For all I know it is still best practices.  So in that
sense no point grepping / reading /proc/cpuinfo as that has clear limits.

Thank you all very much for the suggestions, after testing, each of them would be a viable solution in certain contexts.  Code for benchmarking:

# preliminaries
install.packages("microbenchmark")
library(microbenchmark)


data <- new.env()
data$ans2 <- 0

data$fun.value <- numeric(1000)

}

returnFirst <- function(fun) function(...) do.call(fun,list(...))[[1]]

# benchmark all functions

               all2 = optim(c(-1,2), rosenbrock_all2),

# correct parameters and return values?
env <- optim(c(-1,2), rosenbrock_env, data = data)

rosenbrock_env and _env2 functions differ in that _env accesses vectors in the defined environment by indexing, whereas _env2 doesn't (hope I interpreted this right?).  This appears to be expensive operation, but allows saving values during the steps of the optim iteration, rather than just at convergence.  Overall, _extra has consistently lowest median execution time!

My earlier workaround was to write two separate functions, one of which returns extra values; all suggested approaches simplify that approach considerably.  I am also now more educated about attributes and environments that I did not know how to utilize before and that proved to be very useful concepts.  Again, thank you everyone for your input!

But why time methods that the author (me!) has been telling the community for
years have updates? Especially as optimx::optimr() uses same syntax as optim()
and gives access to a number of solvers, both production and didactic. This set
of solvers is being improved or added to regularly, with a major renewal almost
complete (for the adventurous, code on https://github.com/nashjc/optimx).

Note also that the default Nelder-Mead is good for exploring function surface and
is quite robust at getting quickly into the region of a minimum, but can be quite
poor in "finishing" the process. Tools have different strengths and weaknesses.
optim() was more or less state of the art a couple of decades ago, but there are
other choices now.

Hi Dirk,

Do you think it's worth also/instead considering a fix to S4 to avoid
this caching issue in future R versions?

(This is top of my for me as we consider the design of S7, and I
recently made a note to ensure we avoid similar problems there:
https://github.com/RConsortium/OOP-WG/issues/317)

Hi Gabriel,

Nice idea! I have encountered this problem several times, while probably a
better management of libraries could avoided the issue this is an elegant
solution.

How would this proposal handle arguments mask.ok, include.only and exclude?
For example, in the (edge) case two packages export a function with the
same name but we want to mask one of them (pkgA::fun, pkgC::fun).
How would that work for instance in library(c("pkgA", "pkgC"), mask.ok = c(
pkgC = "fun"))?
Would the name of the character be useful to decide which one is ok to
mask? (in the example I would expect the pkgC::fun be masked by pkgA::fun in
the inverse order or loading).

If this doesn't go ahead, perhaps a function could be implemented to check
these situations in the .libPaths (in a package if not in base) ?

That is somewhat orthogonal to my point of "'some uses' of the 20 year old S4
system (which as we know is fairly widely used 'out there') break
deployments" and the related "this is also a PITA for binary distributors".

The existing body of code seems to need some help.

I haven't followed the S7 repo closely but peek every couple of months. It
seems sensible to avoid repeating shortcomings identfied elsewhere.

Message-ID: <CAD7Bkx8Y44Gy=sW+mMfyXqpg3gcGKojS9A0zbrHzF_qqJsvYAg@mail.gmail.com>

I fielded a debugging request from a non-expert user today. At root
was running the following:

dbGetQuery(connection = conn, query = query)

The problem is that they've named the arguments incorrectly -- it
should have been [1]:

dbGetQuery(conn = conn, statement = query)

The problem is that the error message "looks" highly confusing to the
untrained eye:

Error in (function (classes, fdef, mtable)  :   unable to find an
inherited method for function ?dbGetQuery? for signature ?"missing",
"missing"?

In retrospect, of course, this makes sense -- the mis-named arguments
are getting picked up by '...', leaving the required arguments
missing.

But I was left wondering how we could help users right their own ship here.

Would it help to mention the argument names? To include some code
checking for weird combinations of missing arguments? Any other
suggestions?

Hi Michael,

I can't help with S4, but I can help to make sure this isn't a problem
with S7. What do you think of the current error message? Do you see
anything obvious we could do to improve?

library(S7)

dbGetQuery <- new_generic("dbGetQuery", c("conn", "statement"))
dbGetQuery(connection = NULL, query = NULL)
#> Error: Can't find method for generic `dbGetQuery(conn, statement)`:

I forwarded that along to the original reporter with positive feedback
-- including the argument names is definitely a big help for cuing
what exactly is missing.

Would a patch to do something similar for S4 be useful?

I just want to add my 2 cents that I think it would be very useful and
beneficial to improve S4 to surface that information as well.

More information about the way that the dispatch failed would be of great
help in situations like the one Michael pointed out.

Subject: [Rd] as.matrix.dist patch (performance)
Message-ID: <c919dc37-e226-3b9c-74a8-455c5dea79af@hiddenelephants.co.uk>

Please find attached a small patch to improve the performance of 
as.matrix.dist().? It's a tiny bit more involved than the current code 
but does bring a reasonable speed improvement for larger <dist> objects 
(remaining comparable for smaller ones).

Example:

set.seed(1)
dat <- matrix(rnorm(20000), ncol = 2);
system.time(as.matrix(dist(dat)))

As of r84931:

 ?? user? system elapsed
 ? 3.370?? 1.154?? 4.535

With this patch:

 ?? user? system elapsed
 ? 1.925?? 0.754?? 2.685

Submitting here in the first instance but happy to move to Bugzilla if 
more appropriate.

Cheers

Tim

 feature request: optim() iteration of functions that return
 multiple values

Another option that is similar to Enrico's is to use object oriented
programming with R6 or reference objects.  I prefer the R6 package
(which will still use an environment like Enrico, but with some
different syntax and a little easier if you want to do this multiple
times.

Here is some example code (this grows the vectors inefficiently, which
could be improved, but it is fast as is):

library(R6)

RB <- R6Class("RB",
    public=list(
      x = numeric(0),
      y = numeric(0),
      val=numeric(0),
      fun = function(x) {
        x1 <- x[1]
        x2 <- x[2]
        self$x <- c(self$x, x1)
        self$y <- c(self$y, x2)
        ans <- 100*(x2-x1*x1)^2 + (1-x1)^2
        self$val <- c(self$val, ans)
        ans
      }
    )
)

rb1 <- RB$new()
optim(c(-1.2, 1), rb1$fun)
plot(rb1$x, rb1$y, type='l')

rb2 <- RB$new()
optim(c(0,1), rb2$fun)
lines(rb2$x, rb2$y, col='blue')

library(optimx)

rb3 <- RB$new()
optimr(c(-1.2,1), rb3$fun)
lines(rb3$x, rb3$y, col='red')

rb4 <- RB$new()
optimr(c(-1.2,1), rb4$fun, method='hjn')
lines(rb4$x, rb4$y, col='forestgreen')

Here's the upshot for the example on DBI:

dbGetQuery(connection = conn, query = query)
Error: unable to find an inherited method for function ?dbGetQuery?
for signature ?conn="missing", statement="missing"?

I don't have any confidence about edge cases / robustness of this
patch for generic S4 use cases (make check-all seems fine), but I
don't suppose a full patch would be dramatically different from the
above.

Good you checked, but you are right that that's not all enough to be sure:

Checking error *messages* is not something we do often {not
the least because you'd need to consider message translations
and hence ensure you only check in case of English ...}.

    > but I don't suppose a full patch would be dramatically different from the

I agree: The patch looks to make sense to me, too,
while I'm not entirely sure about the extra   call. = FALSE
 (which I of course understand you'd prefer for the above example)

Now I'd like to find an example that only uses packages with priority
 base | Recommended

Dear ???,

Thank you for your message, but please follow the posting guide in your
future messages: https://www.r-project.org/posting-guide.html
https://www.r-project.org/bugs.html

I understand from your link that list.files() ends up skipping some
Chinese filenames in R-4.3.1 (but not R-4.2.2) on Windows, but would you
(or perhaps Yihui Xie who I see is also participating in the discussion)
mind translating the rest of your findings into English? Have you been
able to narrow down the problem to certain character ranges, for
example?

My thinking is the signature of the internal .InheritForDispatch() is
not likely to help anyone,
in fact having the opposite effect for beginners unsure how to use that info.

> Now I'd like to find an example that only uses packages with priority base | Recommended

Sure, here are a few.

library(Matrix)
# searching for Matrix-owned generics
matrix_generics <- getGenerics(where = asNamespace("Matrix"))
matrix_generics at .Data[matrix_generics at package == "Matrix"]

# simple signature, one argument 'x'
symmpart()
# Error: unable to find an inherited method for function ?symmpart?
for signature ?x="missing"?

# more complicated signature, especially including ...
Cholesky(a = 1)
# Error: unable to find an inherited method for function ?Cholesky?
for signature ?A="missing"?
Cholesky(a = 1, perm = TRUE)
# Error: unable to find an inherited method for function ?Cholesky?
for signature ?A="missing"?
Cholesky(a = 1, perm = TRUE, IMult = 2)
# Error: unable to find an inherited method for function ?Cholesky?
for signature ?A="missing"?

---

'base' is a bit harder since stats4 just provides classes over stats
functions, so the missigness error comes from non-S4 code.

library(stats4)
coef()
# Error in coef.default() : argument "object" is missing, with no default

Defining our own generic:

setGeneric("BaseGeneric", \(a, ...) standardGeneric("BaseGeneric"))
BaseGeneric()
# Error: unable to find an inherited method for function ?BaseGeneric?
for signature ?a="missing"?

# getting multiple classes to show up requires setting the signature:
setMethod("BaseGeneric", signature(x = "double", y = "double"), \(x,
y, ...) x + y)
BaseGeneric(X = 1, Y = 2)
# Error: unable to find an inherited method for function ?BaseGeneric?
for signature ?x="missing", y="missing"?

Subject: [Rd] R 4.3: Change in behaviour of as.character.POSIXt for datetime
 values with midnight time
Message-ID: <FD698A33-CC16-4B95-8907-4C0052E58913@gmail.com>

I understand that `as.character.POSIXt()` had an overhaul in R 4.3 (https://github.com/wch/r-source/commit/f6fd993f8a2f799a56dbecbd8238f155191fc31b), and I have come across a new behaviour and I wonder if it is unintended?

When calling `as.character.POSIXt()` on a vector that contains elements where the time component is midnight (00:00:00), it drops the time component of that element in the resulting character vector. Previously the time component was retained: 

In R 4.2.3:

```
R.version$version.string
#> [1] "R version 4.2.3 (2023-03-15)"

(t <- as.POSIXct(c("1975-01-01 00:00:00", "1975-01-01 15:27:00")))
#> [1] "1975-01-01 00:00:00 PST" "1975-01-01 15:27:00 PST?

(tc <- as.character(t))
#> [1] "1975-01-01 00:00:00" "1975-01-01 15:27:00?
```

In R 4.3.1:

```
R.version$version.string
#> [1] "R version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16)"

(t <- as.POSIXct(c("1975-01-01 00:00:00", "1975-01-01 15:27:00")))
#> [1] "1975-01-01 00:00:00 PST" "1975-01-01 15:27:00 PST?

(tc <- as.character(t))
#> [1] "1975-01-01" "1975-01-01 15:27:00?
```

This has consequences when round-tripping from POSIXt -> character -> POSIXt, since `as.POSIXct.character()` drops the time component from the entire vector if any element does not have a time component:

In R 4.2.3:

```

In R 4.3.1:

```
R.version$version.string
#> [1] "R version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16)?

(t <- as.POSIXct(c("1975-01-01 00:00:00", "1975-01-01 15:27:00")))

as.POSIXct(tc)
#> [1] "1975-01-01 PST" "1975-01-01 PST?
```

`format.POSIXt()` retains its old behaviour in R 4.3:

```
R.version$version.string
#> [1] "R version 4.2.3 (2023-03-15)"

(t <- as.POSIXct(c("1975-01-01 00:00:00", "1975-01-01 15:27:00")))
#> [1] "1975-01-01 00:00:00 PST" "1975-01-01 15:27:00 PST?

(tf <- format(t))
#> [1] "1975-01-01 00:00:00" "1975-01-01 15:27:00?

as.POSIXct(tf)
#> [1] "1975-01-01 00:00:00 PST" "1975-01-01 15:27:00 PST?
```

```
R.version$version.string
#> [1] "R version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16)"

(t <- as.POSIXct(c("1975-01-01 00:00:00", "1975-01-01 15:27:00")))
#> [1] "1975-01-01 00:00:00 PST" "1975-01-01 15:27:00 PST?

(tf <- format(t))
#> [1] "1975-01-01 00:00:00" "1975-01-01 15:27:00?

as.POSIXct(tf)
#> [1] "1975-01-01 00:00:00 PST" "1975-01-01 15:27:00 PST?
```

And finally, the behaviour of `as.POSIXct.character()` has not changed (it previously did, and still does, drop the time component from all elements when any element has no time):

```R.version$version.string
#> [1] "R version 4.2.3 (2023-03-15)"

as.POSIXct(c("1975-01-01", "1975-01-01 15:27:00"))
#> [1] "1975-01-01 PST" "1975-01-01 PST?
```

```R.version$version.string
#> [1] "R version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16)"

as.POSIXct(c("1975-01-01", "1975-01-01 15:27:00"))
#> [1] "1975-01-01 PST" "1975-01-01 PST?
```

I don?t know if this is a bug/regression in `as.character.POSIXt()`, or intended behaviour. If it is intended, I think it would benefit from some more comprehensive documentation.

Thanks very much,
Andy Teucher

Yes, I participated in the discussion. Basically dir() failed to list all
files since R 4.3.0 when filenames start with Chinese characters. I don't
have a Windows machine to test it, but this might be a minimal reproducible
example:

file.create("????.R")
dir()

The OP said dir() would return "????.R" in R.4.2.2 but not in R 4.3.0. In
the same discussion another person mentioned that the problem could also be
related to the file encoding, i.e., if the file content is encoded in
UTF-8, it could be recognized by dir(), but not in ANSI.

Dear Yihui,

Thanks a lot for your help!

Unfortunately, I was not able to reproduce this. I've tried creating
files with Chinese characters in their names and populating them
with valid UTF-8 and valid non-UTF-8 text, but R seems to be able to
list them all in my case.

I'm running a US English evaluation ISO image of a slightly newer build
of Windows 10, and I also compiled R-4.3.1 from source, anticipating
having to single-step through the list.files() implementation:

sessionInfo()
# R version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16 ucrt)

system('cmd /c dir /s *.txt')
#  Volume in drive C has no label.

#

#                0 Dir(s)  29,538,418,688 bytes free
# [1] 0

(The OEM codepage cannot represent the characters I used in the file
names, but all the files are present in both lists.)

In order to find out what's wrong, it will be needed to download the R
source code and compile it [*], install gdb using pacman (part of
Rtools), then set a breakpoint on the list_files function from
src/main/platform.c and step through it [**], paying attention to the
R_readdir calls. Do the missing file names not even come out from
FindNextFile()? Are they somehow skipped around the time of regex match?

(I could help with the details of this, maybe off-list, if there's
interest.)

Unless Tomas Kalibera is able to deduce the root cause from the
observed symptoms, someone who can reproduce the problem will have to
investigate further.

Dear ???,

I believe you that there's a problem with list.files() and file names
in Chinese. There is no need for additional proof. Unfortunately, it's
impossible to fix the problem unless its source is found:
https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs-cn.html

Can you give me more examples of file names, _as text_, that I could
_copy and paste_ into my computer in order to (hopefully) reproduce the
problem here?

Alternatively, can you use a debugger for programs written in C? Do you
know someone who does?

Best regards,
Ivan

I am afraid this issue a bite more complicated.
Test Rgui and Rterm 4.3.1 and svn trunk on Windows 10 x64 (build 19044) , Chinese file name shows correctly (file content ANSI or UTF-8 ).
I saw OP picture (using Rstudio), maybe this is Rstudio issues?

Yes, I participated in the discussion. Basically dir() failed to list all
files since R 4.3.0 when filenames start with Chinese characters. I don't
have a Windows machine to test it, but this might be a minimal reproducible
example:

file.create("????.R")
dir()

The OP said dir() would return "????.R" in R.4.2.2 but not in R 4.3.0. In
the same discussion another person mentioned that the problem could also be
related to the file encoding, i.e., if the file content is encoded in
UTF-8, it could be recognized by dir(), but not in ANSI.

Yihui

Could you test it on RGui and Rterm first, see it work or not. then try RStudio?

Found it! Looks like a buffer length problem. This isn't limited to
Chinese, just more likely to happen when a character takes three bytes
to represent in UTF-8. (Any filename containing characters which take
more than one byte to represent in UTF-8 may fail.)

If a directory contains a file with a sufficiently long name,
FindNextFile() fails with ERROR_MORE_DATA (0xEA, 234), making
R_readdir() return NULL, stopping list_files() prematurely:

# everything seems to work fine...

list.files("????")
# [1] "????-non-utf8-?????
????????????????????????????????????????????????????.txt"
# [2] "????-non-utf8-?????.txt"
# [3] "????-utf-8.txt"

# now create a file with an even longer name

list.files("????")
# [1] "????-non-utf8-?????
????????????????????????????????????????????????????.txt"

# the files are still there, but not visible to list.files():

system("cmd /c dir /s *.txt")
#  Volume in drive C has no label.

Increasing the path length limits [*] doesn't help, since it's the
filename length limit that we're bumping against. While both
WIN32_FIND_DATAA and WIN32_FIND_DATAW contain fixed-size buffers, a
valid filename may take more than MAX_PATH bytes to represent in UTF-8
while still being under the limit of MAX_PATH wide characters. This may
mean having to rewrite list_files in terms of R_wopendir()/R_wreaddir()
for Windows. As a workaround, we may use the short filename (which
sometimes may not exist, alas) when FindNextFile() fails with
ERROR_MORE_DATA.

Dear Yihui,

Thanks a lot for your help!

Unfortunately, I was not able to reproduce this. I've tried creating files with Chinese characters in their names and populating them with valid UTF-8 and valid non-UTF-8 text, but R seems to be able to list them all in my case.

I'm running a US English evaluation ISO image of a slightly newer build of Windows 10, and I also compiled R-4.3.1 from source, anticipating having to single-step through the list.files() implementation:

sessionInfo()
# R version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16 ucrt)

system('cmd /c dir /s *.txt')
#  Volume in drive C has no label.
#  Volume Serial Number is A85A-AA74
#
#  Directory of C:\R\R-4.3.1\bin\x64\????
#
# 08/12/2023  07:57 AM                22 ????-non-utf8-?????.txt
# 08/12/2023  07:56 AM                18 ????-utf-8.txt
#                2 File(s)             40 bytes
#
#      Total Files Listed:
#                2 File(s)             40 bytes
#                0 Dir(s)  29,538,418,688 bytes free
# [1] 0

(The OEM codepage cannot represent the characters I used in the file names, but all the files are present in both lists.)

In order to find out what's wrong, it will be needed to download the R source code and compile it [*], install gdb using pacman (part of Rtools), then set a breakpoint on the list_files function from src/main/platform.c and step through it [**], paying attention to the R_readdir calls. Do the missing file names not even come out from FindNextFile()? Are they somehow skipped around the time of regex match?

(I could help with the details of this, maybe off-list, if there's
interest.)

Unless Tomas Kalibera is able to deduce the root cause from the observed symptoms, someone who can reproduce the problem will have to investigate further.

Well, yes, R-devel builds with clang/flang also for Windows/aarch64. 
I've committed this option (USE_LLVM) last week together with other 
required changes, but it is still work in progress, not documented nor 
well tested.? I have created for this a (subset) of Rtools43 for aarch64 
(available at https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/winutf8/ucrt3/). This goes 
together with efforts of Brian Ripley and CRAN to make CRAN packages 
work with flang.

If you are interested in R on Windows/aarch64, stay tuned. But what I 
have already allows to build R-devel with base and recommended packages 
and to pass check-all, yet still requires some cleanups. R still needs 
to be taught about the new architecture in some places, particularly in 
the package management, now it still thinks it is x64. I've not yet 
gotten to testing any other R packages.

If you were interested in helping out, one thing missing is several 
Rtools43 (MXE) packages that don't yet build with clang for aarch64 
(ping me for details if you are interested).

Best,
Tomas

Looking forward R for windows arm64 . yes, R on aarch64 still think it is x64 , navie grep source code shows: makefiles,some library  R codes and c codes  and installer codes are affected , need to be tuned.

Could you test it on RGui and Rterm first, see it work or not. then try RStudio?

Well, as the NEWS entry says
 (partly visible in the url above -- which only shows one part of
  the several changes for R 4.3) :

    ? as.character(<POSIXt>) now behaves more in line with the methods
      for atomic vectors such as numbers, and is no longer influenced
      by options().  Ditto for as.character(<Date>).  The
      as.character() method gets arguments digits and OutDec with
      defaults _not_ depending on options().  Use of as.character(*,
      format = .) now warns.

It was "inconsistent" to have  as.character(.) basically use format(.) for
these datatime objects.
as.character(x) for basic R types such as numbers, strings, logicals,... 
fulfills the important property

	 as.character(x)[j] === as.character(x[j])

whereas that is very much different for format() where indeed,
the formatting  of  x[1]  may quite a bit depend on the other
x[j]'s values:

> as.character(c(1, pi, pi/2^20))
[1] "1"    "3.14159265358979"   "2.99605622633914e-06"

> format(c(1, pi, pi/2^20))
[1] "1.000000e+00" "3.141593e+00" "2.996056e-06"
> format(c(1, pi))
[1] "1.000000" "3.141593"
> format(c(1, 10))
[1] " 1" "10"

    > When calling `as.character.POSIXt()` on a vector that contains elements where the time component is midnight (00:00:00), it drops the time component of that element in the resulting character vector. Previously the time component was retained:

You should have used format()  here  or at least should do so now.

    > This has consequences when round-tripping from POSIXt ->
    > character -> POSIXt,
    
Well, I'd argue that such a "round trip" is not a "good idea"
anyway, as there are quite a few platform (local timezone for
one) issues, and precision is lost, notably for POSIXlt which
may be more precise than you typically get, etc. 

    > since `as.POSIXct.character()` drops the time component from the entire vector if any element does not have a time component:

Well, there *is* no as.POSIXct.character()  {but we understand what you mean}: 
If you look at the help page you'd see that there's  as.POSIXlt.character()
{which is called from as.POSIXct.default()}
with a 3rd argument 'format' and a 4th argument 'tryFormats'
{and a lot more information -- the whole topic is far from trivial}.

Now, indirectly you would want R to be "smart", i.e. the
as.POSIXlt.character() method "guess better" about what the
user wants. ...
... and I agree that is not an unreasonable expectation, e.g.,
for your example of wanting 

    c("1975-01-01", "1975-01-01 15:27:00")

to  "work".

as.POSIXlt.character() is well documented to be trying all of
the `tryFormats` in order, until it finds one that works for all
vector components (or fail / use NA if none works);
and here it's only a format which drops the time that works for
all (i.e. both, in the example).

{ Even though its behavior is well documented,
  one could even argue that by default you'd want a warning in
  such a case where "so much" is lost.
  I think however that introducing such a warning  may trip too
  much current code relying .. also, the extra *checking* maybe
  somewhat costly .. (?)  .... anyway that's an interesting side topic
}

Instead what you want here is for each string (element of the
character vector) to try the `tryFormats and using the best
available *individually*  {smart R users ==> "think lapply(.)"} :
Currently, this would be  "something like"  unlist(lapply(x, as.POSIXlt))
well, and then you need to jump a hoop additionally.
If you want POSIXct,  like this :

   .POSIXct(unlist(lapply( * , as.POSIXct))))

For your example

  ch <- c("1975-01-01", "1975-01-01 15:27:00")

> str(.POSIXct(unlist(lapply(ch, as.POSIXct))))
 POSIXct[1:2], format: "1975-01-01 00:00:00" "1975-01-01 15:27:00"

---

After all that, yes, I agree that we should consider making
this much easier. E.g.,  by adding an optional argument to
as.POSIXlt.character()   say, `each` with default FALSE such
that as.POSIXlt(*,  each=TRUE)
{and also as.POSIXct(*,  each=TRUE) } would follow the above
strategy.

Martin,

Thank you. Everything you have written is helpful and I admit I am likely guilty of using as.character() instead of format() in the past().

Ignoring the above though, one thing I?m still unclear on is the special handling of zero (or rather non-zero time) seconds in the method. Is the motivation that as.character() outputs the minimum necessary information? It is clearly a very deliberate choice but the reasoning is still going a little over my head.

Best

Tim

Just to rule it out... is it possible that R is listing these files
successfully, but is not printing the Chinese characters in those
names for some reason?

Using your example, what is the output of:

    f <- list.files(a, recursive = T)
    nchar(f)

Does the reported number of characters match what you see?

Best,
Kevin

For the record, if you are experimenting with building R-devel using 
msys2 toolchains, you should also remove various _STATIC macros from the 
make files (as you are linking dynamically).

There is a document I wrote with more details 
(https://developer.r-project.org/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/winutf8.html). It 
is very outdated, but at least this part still applies, and points to a 
patch: https://developer.r-project.org/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/nostatic.diff

Dynamic linking against third party libraries on Windows is not 
officially supported by R. This is only useful for experimenting, e.g. 
for testing R code on compilers available in msys2 but not yet in Rtools 
(and I have done that myself with Windows/aarch64 before building Rtools 
for the platform).

Subject: [Rd] Unclear provenance of message from S4
Message-ID: <CAD7Bkx_K4K34th3qXuXCLU7WhEfLt7wcOFrtdQBWNxpxbg-fBQ@mail.gmail.com>

MRE to produce the message is the following:

setClass("Foo")
setOldClass("Bar")
setAs("Bar", "Foo", \(x) x)
# NOTE: arguments in definition for coerce changed from (x) to (from)

In an interactive setting, that may be fine, but I first encountered
this message in the install log of a package for which I am not the
author (nor do I have any context on the package, really).

As such it took me much longer than it otherwise would have to pick up
on the connection between 'coerce' and 'setAs' (as searching the
sources for 'coerce' yielded nothing). That the faulty argument is the
ubiquitous 'x' is also a major impediment.

It would be much better to surface the relationship to 'setAs' in this message.

I believe that logic has to live in setAs itself as the delegated
substituteFunctionArgs loses the proper context (unless we dare to
resort to sys.calls()).

Sharing here first per usual as I am not very familiar with S4, in
case this all is much clearer to someone with a sharper eye for S4.

Thanks, Ivan, could you please turn this into a complete minimal 
reproducible example, ideally with only ASCII characters (if enough to 
trigger)? Or any reproducible example would do. I would have a look 
later today.

I admit I didn't get your analysis. However, I've rewritten this code 
for R 4.3 to support long paths (when enabled in the system), more in 
https://blog.r-project.org/2023/03/07/path-length-limit-on-windows/index.html. 
As this was reported to be regression in 4.3, it is entirely possible 
this change came with a regression (though a bit surprising we didn't 
catch it earlier by testing), so it would be a great help if I could 
have the example and debug it.

Thanks,
Tomas

Sorry, let me try to be more clear.

The Windows filename length limit is 255(?) wide characters. The
WIN32_FIND_DATAA structure contains a 260-byte buffer for the filename
to be returned by FindFirstFileA()/FindNextFileA(). If a wide character
takes more than one byte to be represented in UTF-8, it may overflow
the 260 byte limit in the WIN32_FIND_DATAA structure despite being
below the 260 wide character limit. When such an overflow happens,
FindNextFile() returns FALSE with GetLastError() == ERROR_MORE_DATA,
which results in R_readdir() returning NULL and makes list_files() stop
before listing the rest of the directory.

This is easier to make happen by accident with Chinese characters,
because they take three UTF-8 bytes per character.

Take the ? (\uf8) letter. It takes two bytes to represent in UTF-8.
Create a file with a name consisting of this symbol repeated 140 times.
When you run list.files() on the resulting directory on Windows with a
UTF-8 locale, Windows tries to fit (0xc3 0xb8) times 140 into a
260-byte buffer, which doesn't work. I'm afraid the only way to avoid
such a failure is to rewrite R_readdir using the wide character API and
convert the file names on the fly. (Just like mingw readdir() did in
the past?)

stopifnot(.Platform$OS.type == 'windows', l10n_info()$`UTF-8`)
# any character for which nchar(enc2utf8(.), 'bytes') > 1 will do
# any number >260/2 should do
file.create(strrep('\uf8', 140))
list.files()

Does this work? I don't have access to a UTF-8 Windows machine right
now.

Ivan

Hmm, I really don't understand what you don't understand.
Here's some annotated R code exemplifying that indeed now,
    as.character(x)[j] === as.character(x[j])
but previously that was not fulfilled  {when  as.character() was
the same as format() for POSIXct or POSIXlt}:

##-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
x0 <- c("1975-01-01 00:00:00", "1975-01-01 15:27:00")
t0 <- as.POSIXct(x0)
str(t0) #  POSIXct[1:2], format: "1975-01-01 00:00:00" "1975-01-01 15:27:00"
t0    #  "1975-01-01 00:00:00 CET" "1975-01-01 15:27:00 CET"
t0[1] #  "1975-01-01 CET" <-- yes, *no* 00:00:00   in no version of R

## In R <= 4.2.x  as.character() was using format() for POSIX{ct,lt} :
as.character(t0)    # "1975-01-01 00:00:00" "1975-01-01 15:27:00" << for R <= 4.2.x
as.character(t0)    # "1975-01-01"          "1975-01-01 15:27:00" << for R >= 4.3.0
as.character(t0[1]) # "1975-01-01"  {in all versions of R}


Note that indeed   as.character()  does drop redundant trailing 0s :

  > as.character(c(0.5, 0.75, pi))
  [1] "0.5"              "0.75"             "3.14159265358979"

whereas format() does not (ensuring resulting strings of the same nchar(.)):

  > format(      c(0.5, 0.75, pi))
  [1] "0.500000" "0.750000" "3.141593"

 R 4.3: Change in behaviour of as.character.POSIXt for datetime

Many thanks Martin!

I was completely overlooking the behaviour for a length 1 vector with 
00:00:00. More coffee needed for me I think.

Subject: [Rd] Heads up about documentation-related reports
Message-ID: <CAGCrKXeM_8AS4sB7tADrGme0PGygjYre9k==Ditkp8=JvK5=ig@mail.gmail.com>

For the upcoming R Sprint I'm proposing a project to improve documentation
<https://contributor.r-project.org/r-project-sprint-2023/projects/documentation/>.
Part of the project will include several small related reports; for
instance, trying to improve examples of many functions (here's a list of
some of the possible reports
<https://contributor.r-project.org/r-project-sprint-2023/projects/documentation/#bugs-to-report>
).

Would it be better to send one single big report or many small reports?

Cheers,
Elio

Thanks, yes, I can reproduce the problem. Some Windows functions impose 
260 wide characters limit, but other 260 bytes limit, so one can create 
a file with a name too long to be found by FindNextFileA.

In R 4.2, we used readdir() from mingw-w64, which itself used findnext, 
which however had the same problem, it used a buffer of size 260 bytes 
and from the code of mingw-w64 and the Windows documentation, it should 
have behaved the same, it should have stopped the search on such a long 
file name. However, in my use case, R 4.2.3 crashed inside findnext due 
to stack overrun, R 4.1.3 worked, but clearly it would require a 
different use case to overrun this buffer as it didn't use UTF-8. This 
suggests that findnext didn't have a check for this and hence caused 
memory corruption, which can lead to a crash or work by coincidence. 
Which could have been the case for the user reporting this as a 
regression compared to R 4.2. But it is not a regression, the problem 
existed for long.

So, yes, we'd probably have to use wide variants of FindNext/FindFirst. 
I'll fix.

Thanks for debugging this,
Tomas

Dear ???,

as discussed on this thread, Ivan Krylov found a bug in R, which could 
be causing the problem you have run into. To confirm this is the cause, 
could you please check outside R (say in explorer) if you have any file 
with a very long name in the directory? And if so, does moving that file 
away make the problem disappear? Files with up to 80 characters couldn't 
trigger this bug.

A workaround for this bug is not to use file names with more than 80 
(possibly all Chinese) characters.

The content of a file (or whether the content is in UTF-8 or not) cannot 
be influencing this problem directly, neither list.files() nor Windows 
looks into the files when listing them.

The bug Ivan found is not a regression: older versions of R may crash 
when you have such long file names. So there would be no point staying 
with an older version to overcome this problem: the only reliable 
work-around I can think of is use reasonably short file names.

Best
Tomas

Fixed in R-devel (84960). Please let me know if you see any problem with 
the fix.

That's good, thank you.

However, do concentrate on the existing bugzilla issues
   https://contributor.r-project.org/r-project-sprint-2023/projects/documentation/#list-of-bugs

(and can you *PLEASE* (change the CSS or ?? to) make the table
 of relevant bugzilla entries wider so it becomes readable ?!)

    > Cheers,

{Do you mean bugzilla bug reports? 
 In that case, maybe rather  *none* [see also below]:
 If you do not like an example that is definitely not a bug in R!
 ---> https://www.r-project.org/bugs.html  "What is a bug"

 Also:  Every bugzilla report (and comment) creates an e-mail to
        all of R core.  Yes, we can sort / pre-filter /
        .. e-mails, but still
}

Well, as co-author of many of R's help page examples, I must say
that "improving" an example needs to have a well defined notion
of "bad - better - good" etc.
In my opinion much of that is a matter of taste rather than objectivity.

As an R core member I'd not like you to propose changing
examples I or others had chosen to be "funny" , "cute",
"special", or "thought provoking" ... just because other people
think that such examples should be as simple (and boring) as possible.

I hope the helpers at the upcoming R Sprint will concentrate on improving R
by following what R core member Luke Tierney and Tomas Kalibera
wrote in their two R blogs:
 ==> https://blog.r-project.org/
   and look for the 2 blog entries with  "Reviewing Bug Reports"
   in their title.


I'm sorry if the above does not sound encouraging..
I hope it still does encourage to rather concentrate on helping
to make R better by reviewing bugs, fixing bugs, exploring
problems, etc. 

With regards,
Martin

well, well, ..
Here on R-devel, we got two messages in addition to mine,
none by any "official" (even though John C Nash probably gets
the title of most senior professor still active on the R mailing list),
but both to the point,
notably Aidan Lakshman below showing you how you were unaware of
several things about the SVD, and confusing
positive semi definite matrices with arbitrary symmetric matrices.

I don't think so.  I think we all agreed (John Nash, me, Aidan Lakshman),
even though focussing on different aspects of your partly
incorrect claims.

Dear Martin, I am getting different responses from different officials of
R-Software, but those statements are contradicting with the statements
discussed in your email. Kindly go through the previous files and emails,
and respond. I personally think, together we can fix the issue which is
observed in SVD.

Thanks and regards
Durga Prasad

a little more information for this issue.
Search in MS website today , found doc about "Maximum Path Length Limitation", Maximum Path Length Limitation - Win32 apps | Microsoft Learn<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation?tabs=registry> .
According the doc, need to do two things to avoid this issue on window 10  and latter:
1 edit registry or group policy  set    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem] "LongPathsEnabled"=dword:00000001

2 app manifest (R already done it)

Fixed in R-devel (84960). Please let me know if you see any problem with
the fix.

Thank you for implementing the fix! I gave ??? the link to the
GitHub Action build of the r84960 installer.

I'm worried that ??? was seeing FindNextFileA fail for a different
reason (all the examples given at the Capital of Statistics forum
seemed to use less than 256/4 = 64 characters per file name...), but
maybe this won't reappear with the switch to FindNextFileW. If this
keeps happening, it might be worth producing a warning when
FindNextFileW() fails with an unexpected GetLastError() value.

fs::dir_fs() uses NtQueryDirectoryFile() and WideCharToMultiByte()
instead of FindNextFileW() and wcstombs(), but maybe this shouldn't
matter. In particular, both list.files() and fs::dir_fs() would fail
given a file name that cannot be represented in UTF-8 (invalid UTF-16
surrogate pairs?)

Ivan

These settings are for long paths (meaning a full path containing of 
multiple elements separated by backslashes), more about that is also in 
[1].


But the problem that Ivan reported (which is not clear whether it is the 
same problem as the one reported originally on this thread), is about 
the limit for a single file/directory name - that is, for a single 
element of a path. Having the long paths enabled in the registry 
wouldn't help with this.


These two limits are not directly related, except the obvious: by 
choosing rather long names for individual files, one usually soon runs 
out of the limit for the full path.

Tomas

I've added a warning to R-devel when list.files() on Windows stops 
listing a directory due to an error.

There is probably not more we can do unless there is a revised bug 
report of the original problem.

Right, R only support file names that are valid strings, this assumption 
is present at many places in the code, so it is fine/consistent to be 
here as well. The choice of opendir/readdir in R was probably motivated 
by minimization of platform-specific code.

Hi Durga,

Just to add to previous comments--if you?re interested in the implementation of SVD in R, I?d recommend looking at the source code and/or sending general questions to the community slack, which may provide faster responses and help with double checking your work. Most of the perceived concerns you mention are related to the underlying LAPACK code--if you can verify that the code in LAPACK and/or R is incorrect, feel free to email r-devel with examples or discuss it on the slack.

The R implementation of SVD is available here, which essentially just wraps LAPACK code:
https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/blob/b6394a83c0c12b12b6b1aceb05db0fd66227fd30/src/modules/lapack/Lapack.c#L111

The R method that invokes the C code is called here:
https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/blob/b6394a83c0c12b12b6b1aceb05db0fd66227fd30/src/library/base/R/LAPACK.R#L19

The related LAPACK code is located here:
https://netlib.org/lapack/explore-html/d1/d7e/group__double_g_esing_gad8e0f1c83a78d3d4858eaaa88a1c5ab1.html

well, well, ..
Here on R-devel, we got two messages in addition to mine,
none by any "official" (even though John C Nash probably gets
the title of most senior professor still active on the R mailing list),
but both to the point,
notably Aidan Lakshman below showing you how you were unaware of
several things about the SVD, and confusing
positive semi definite matrices with arbitrary symmetric matrices.

    > but those statements are contradicting with the statements
    > discussed in your email.

I don't think so.  I think we all agreed (John Nash, me, Aidan Lakshman),
even though focussing on different aspects of your partly
incorrect claims.

You wrote:
         Using singular value decomposition, any second-order tensor is
given as
          A = U?Vt
          where U and V are the orthogonal tensors, and ? is the diagonal
matrix (Eigenvalue matrix).

          For a symmetric matrix, the orthogonal tensors are the same,
i.e., U=V.

Can you state your definition of the SVD and prove (or outline a proof of)
that last statement?

Dear Durga, I think you have a basic misunderstanding of this mailing 
list.  The responses you have received are from users and volunteer 
developers.  There are no "officials of R-Software".  R is an open 
source project containing contributions from hundreds (maybe thousands) 
of people.

It's only natural that there will be some contradictions in the 
responses from those people.  It's up to you to read the responses and 
find the parts of them that are useful to you.  It's rude of you to ask 
one particular respondent to do that work for you.

Thans for the response, Martin.

I've updated the project web page to focus first on the existing bugs and filling new ones, without mention of examples: https://contributor.r-project.org/r-project-sprint-2023/projects/documentation/
The idea was not about removing complex examples but about adding simple examples. Complex examples can be useful to surface advanced functionality or neat usages of a function, but simple examples illustrate basic functionality, particularly for beginners who need to understand how a function behaves in its most simple case before being able to understand any more interesting behaviour or interaction with other functions. That's one criteria for "better" in this context.
Cheers,
Elio

Subject: [Rd] Calling a replacement function in a custom environment
Message-ID: <CAM2gKPYmHX-tPe9YK77_txPets0mPHZOVay36DtFrK5TFTsuLw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I am wondering whether it?s at all possible to call a replacement function
in a custom environment. From my experiments this appears not to be the
case, and I am wondering whether that restriction is intentional.

To wit, the following works:

x = 1
base::is.na(x) = TRUE

However, the following fails:

x = 1
b = baseenv()
b$is.na(x) = TRUE

The error message is "invalid function in complex assignment". Grepping the
R code for this error message reveals that this behaviour seems to be
hard-coded in function `applydefine` in src/main/eval.c: the function
explicitly checks for `::` and :::` and permits those assignments, but has
no equivalent treatment for `$`.

Am I overlooking something to make this work? And if not ? unless there?s a
concrete reason against it, could it be considered to add support for this
syntax, i.e. for calling a replacement function by `$`-subsetting the
defining environment, as shown above?

Cheers,
Konrad

I think there isn't a way to make this work other than calling `is.na<-` 
explicitly:

   x <- b$`is.na<-`(x, TRUE)

It seems like a reasonable suggestion to make

   b$is.na(x) <- TRUE

work as long as b is an environment.

If you wanted it to work when b was a list, it would be more problematic 
because of partial name matching.  E.g. suppose b was a list containing 
functions partial(), partial<-(), and part<-(), and I call

   b$part(x) <- 1

what would be called?

Replacement functions are not intended to be called directly. Calling
a replacement function directly may produce an error, or may just do
the wrong thing in terms of mutation.

I do not think it is a reasonable suggestion. The reasons a::b and
a:::b were made to work is that many users read these as a single
symbol, not a call to a binary operator. So supporting this helped to
reduce confusion.

Allowing $<- to "work" on environments was probably a mistake since
environments behave differently with respect to
duplication. Disallowing it entirely may be too disruptive at this
point, but disallowing it in complex assignment expressions may be
necessary to prevent mutations that should not happen. (There are open
bug reports that boil down to this.)

In any case, complicating the complex assignment code, which is
already barely maintainable, would be a very bad idea.

Best,

luke

Message-ID: <BL3PR11MB6338324A0CEDD90C3DDD013CBEE1A@BL3PR11MB6338.namprd11.prod.outlook.com>

I was curious what R packages, or indeed any other applications, exist
to plot streamed data from arbitrary data generators. It need not
be publication quality plotting but it should be easy to use  like
an oscilloscope.  I was working on something called datascope that I 
am using for 1D finite difference monitoring and recently interfaced it
to freefem. I also created an R package. If there is any interest in something
like this I guess I could put it up somewhere when it is more usable
or if you can suggest some similar popular packages that would be good
too. Is there something I could drop-in to the attached code and get
something like the attached output that could also be switched to other
data sources?  This right now works via linux fifo and somewhat by UDP.
It can queue data and stop making it if no one seems to be  consuming
it depending on the channel.

Thanks.

I think r-package-devel is a better place for this. CC'ing there.

The last time I checked, there wasn't any R package suitable for
plotting high-throughput streaming data.

There's a nice command-line utility called trend [1] that I
extensively used in the past as an oscilloscope to visualize the
output from a DAQ card. I don't see any new development there, but it
does exactly what it promises; it's easy to use, quite configurable
and very fast. Old but gold.

I also explored VisPy, which is much more ambitious, but at that time
the API had a limitation that didn't allow me to achieve what I
required, and I haven't looked at it ever since, but the project seems
in good shape.

Hope it helps,

Conceptually, the same is true for `a$b` when `a` is used as an
environment. In fact, for environments `$` logically acts as a scope
resolution operator in much the same way `::` does. This usage exists
notably for ?R6? classes and ?box? modules, and the fact that replacement
functions cannot be called in such scenarios is a confusing limitation for
users of these packages.

In fact, if the aim of allowing replacement function calls for `a::b` is to
reduce confusion, the same argument applies to `a$b` (and users don?t
understand why the former works but the latter does not ? I?d even argue
that the current inconsistency *increases* rather than reduces confusion).

I generally agree with this, but the current behaviour is inconsistent,
confusing, and breaks seemingly-straightforward and actively useful code.

Cheers,
Konrad

Hello,

Has any consideration or work been done to document or perform vulnerability testing for the R packages?  In order to bring in software to my environments, I need to research known vulnerabilities (I usually use MITRE's CVE page) and also perform local Fortify and Nessus scans to determine an NVD score.  It would be a huge help to have a way to package whatever tools/libraries/etc into a adhoc package or a breakdown of an R release contents to aid in vulnerability assessments.  Developers ask for specific library files and if I could map them to a package it would greatly reduce the amount of research.

Is is specifically about third-party R packages or about R ecosystem as
a whole, including R itself?

This depends on your threat model, but generally, it's best not to
process untrusted data in R. As an example, see the stack overflow in
unserialize(), reported on R Bugzilla a few years ago. I am not aware
of any current vulnerabilities in R's built-in help server or the
network server packages hosted on CRAN, but I am not aware of them
having passed security audits, either, so it's best not to let R listen
on network ports on public networks.

CRAN packages are supposed to declare their third-party dependencies in
the SystemRequirements: field of their DESCRIPTION, but that's not the
only way a package could be bringing third-party code in the address
space of the R process. For example, some packages bundle their
dependencies inside the package archive without declaring anything,
which may mean falling behind in terms of security updates.

The CRAN team does their best to enforce the policy regarding the
third-party dependencies [*], but CRAN packages come with no warranty.

> or a breakdown of an R release contents

Would R Installation and Administration [**] help? R has a few
third-party dependencies, slightly different depending on the platform
(Windows/macOS/Unix-alikes), so make sure to check the sections for all
operating systems.

By library files, do you mean external dependencies of a package, the
packages themselves, or something completely different?
