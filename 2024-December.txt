Subject: [Rd] 'else' on new line not parsed at top level as part of
 preceding 'if'
Message-ID: <2d467cfb-3a83-4bb7-ae73-ac4d1d8d0b70@gmail.com>

I wonder if there is room for improvement here:

     > str2lang("if (a) b1    else b0")
     if (a) b1 else b0
     > str2lang("if (a) b1 \n else b0")
     Error in str2lang("if (a) b1 \n else b0") : <text>:2:2: unexpected 'else'
     1: if (a) b1
     2:  else
         ^

It only occurs at top level.  When the parser knows that it needs to
"keep reading", e.g., because the call to 'if' is enclosed in braces,
it detects the 'else':

     > str2lang("{ if (a) b1    else b0 }")
     {
         if (a)
             b1
         else b0
     }
     > str2lang("{ if (a) b1 \n else b0 }")
     {
         if (a)
             b1
         else b0
     }

If people agree that the above is a deficiency/bug then I could create a
formal bug report.  Then others or I could start thinking about a patch
for the parser.

Apologies if this issue has been seen and discussed before (most likely
by people like me in the habit of dropping braces in calls to 'if' where
not strictly necessary).

This is well known, and it's necessary for reasonable behaviour in an 
interactive context.  Imagine typing the code you were parsing.  The 
first line is

  if (a) b1

At this point, the interpreter can't know that an else clause is coming. 
  Since the interpreter evaluates statements when they are complete, it 
will evaluate this and return b1 or NULL.

Putting the full expression in braces solves the issue, because this is 
clearly incomplete:

   { if (a) b1

Thanks - that makes sense.  It's also documented in help("if"), so it's
doubly clear now that I did not do my homework here.

Subject: [Rd] Exposing native httpd server
Message-ID: <a7cada24-51e9-4e48-8977-07b913fb40ff@gmail.com>

R has a native HTTP server that is used for serving R help pages 
interactively, at least on the loopback device (127.0.0.1)

But all of the working are internal, not exposed to user and not documented.
This is quite shame since the server seems to be fully capable of 
handling basic tasks,
be it serving static websites or even interactively processing queries.

This was previously noticed by Jeffry Horner, the author of the Rook 
package.
I am just a guy who found it interesting.

The basic working is as follows:
User needs to either overwrite the internal `tools:::httpd` function or 
add their hook into the internal environment tools:::.httpd.handlers.env.

In the former case, the user will be of a full control of the server, in 
the later case, the `app` will be hooked to `/custom/app` instead.
All that is needed then is to run the interactive help that starts the 
webserver.

Based on the breadcrumbs left on the way, I was able to write a server 
that emulates much more complex `servr` package that I have previously 
used to test locally my blog.

https://gist.github.com/J-Moravec/497d71f4a4b7a204235d093b3fa69cc3

You can see that I am forced to do some illegal procedures:
 ?* tools:::httpd needs to be replaced
 ?* the server doesn't have knowledge of a directory so setwd needs to 
be set
 ?* the function must not end, otherwise the directory is changed during 
the server lifetime (and depends on the current working directory)

I would like to suggest and probe for willingness to expose the native 
http server.
This would include:

* de-hardcoding the server so that we can register other functions not 
just httpd
* exporting many functions and renaming them (such as mime_type)
* writing better interfaces, `startDynamicHelp` is kind of hard to work 
with, something like httpd_start(dir, fun, port), httpd_stop(port) and 
httpd_status(port) would be much cleaner.

I would like to say that I have no idea what I am doing, I don't 
understand webtech or the internal implementation, so if there are 
reasons why this isn't a great idea...

I am happy to make a PR for the R part. 
https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/trunk/src/library/tools/R/dynamicHelp.R
The C part with the R's C internals look to me like a black magic and I 
don't feel confident enough.

-m SimpleHTTPServer 8080`

This has been available for a long time. The 'webutils' package has
basic examples of how to handle and parse http requests in R using
either using Rhttpd or httpuv:

   webutils::demo_rhttpd()
   webutils::demo_httpuv()

You can adapt from here to your needs. R provides all the hooks you
need, I think you'll find little appetite for duplicating more web
server tooling into base R.

Ji??,

in a sense there are two quite different issue that you are touching upon. On one hand, your request for exposing the http server is something I was pretty much expecting. In order to judge the appetite for it I have included the support for custom handlers back then as inofficial API specifically so that if anyone cares we could work on refining it (really only Jeff and Hadley ever asked and/or provided feedback). But I would argue over time it became more clear that it's probably not the way to go.

The real problem is that we don't really want to "just" expose the server because of the implications that you mentioned indirectly: the server is deliberately run in the current R session - which is pretty much exactly what we want for the help system, but it is something that is in most cases undesirable for several reasons. Firstly, normal R user does not expect http requests to mess with their analysis (e.g. changing the working directory would certainly not be welcome), so we don't want random code to execute and interfere with user's work. Secondly, http services are usually expected to be scalable and not interfere with each other - which is not possible directly here with the server as-is since it is fully serial within the user's session. What is truly desired strongly depends on the use-case: some applications would prefer a forked session for each connection, other may want co-operation in a separate environment. It is all doable, but beyond the scope of R's internal http server.

Moreover the internal http server is based on the Rserve package and you always have much larger flexibility there. There are also higher level abstractions like RestRserve. So if you like the internal server then you can seamlessly use Rserve as the API was derived from there. Of course there are other alternatives in package space like httpuv. We typically don't want to fold things into core R unless it's absolutely necessary - i.e., if they can happily live in package space.

In short, I'm still not convinced that you really want to use the built-in sever. Although it is a fully featured http server, it was included for a very specific purpose, and it's not clear that it would be a good fit for other purposes.

That said, I'm interested in ideas about what users would want to use it for. There may be use-cases which do fit the design so we could make it happen. I would recommend looking at Rserve first, because anything implemented there is trivial to add to R (as it is the same code base) if it would make sense. So I'm open to suggestions, but they should be centered around what cannot be done already.

Cheers,
Simon

Dear Simon and Jeroen,

thank you for your answers. I have to reiterate that I am out of my 
depth in here. My knowledge of http is clicking links and not much 
beyond that.

I will definitely look into `webutils` and `Rserve`.

One of the reason why I brought this issue is that I have a static site 
generator that uses the pkg `servr` to serve the static site locally, 
before I push it to github pages.
This allowed me to remove some 12 dependencies.
For this, the internal R webserver seems to be completely sufficient and 
I thought that it would be nice to have this functionality without it 
being "illegal" (i.e., replacing internal function)
and possibly documented so that the limitations are clear.

As for the limitations, IMHO when implemented as I did (Sys.sleep(Inf), 
setting path, and reset on exit), it behaves like most shiny apps I saw, 
or many apps in general.
So when I think about it as kind of user interface within browser 
instead of written in something like tcl/tk instead of a part of 
internet infrastructure, it feels quite sufficient to me.

Lately, I have been quite minimalist and I found a great joy finding 
that base is quite bit more powerful than people often think so, so I am 
quite happy finding out that the internal R server is fully sufficient 
for me,
but can't speak for other people and their intended use.

So we can leave it at that. Maybe in few more years when I am more 
familiar with web architecture and R internals, I can make a better 
argument, hopefully followed with some rad code.

   I absolutely appreciate the desire for minimalism.  On the other hand 
Rserve has no dependencies other than R >= 1.5.0 (!!!), so you would in 
any case be cutting your dependencies way down (`servr` has 16 recursive 
dependencies of which 5 seem to be base/recommended, presumably this is 
where your count of 12 came from; `Rserve` has none).

Hi Ben,

yes, in this particular case, I am moving from `rmarkdown` and `servr` 
to `litedown` and (internal http server), which will remove 30 dependencies.

```

base = utils::installed.packages(priority = "base") |> rownames()
litedown = tools::package_dependencies("litedown", recursive = TRUE)

setdiff(
 ? tools::package_dependencies(c("rmarkdown" , "servr"), recursive = 
TRUE) |> unlist(),
 ? c(base, litedown)
 ? ) |> length()
```

I will check the Rserve. It is described as socket server and I didn't 
get into reading into sockets yet, so I didn't look deeper.

The internal web-server is designed specifically to run R code, but what you describe above is something entirely different, because you don?t need to run R code to serve static files. That is order of magnitude easier (and you *really* don?t want to use R to serve the files). Unlike serving R code, that part can be done on a separate thread so it doesn't have all the issues we talked about.

If all you want is to serve the local directory at the root of the URLs then you can use the Rserve package as follows:

Rserve:::Rserve.http.add.static("","",last=TRUE)
Rserve::run.Rserve(http.port=8080, qap=FALSE)

(prefix="" means all paths will be served by the static server, path="" means everything is relative to the current directory and last=TRUE means you don?t want to proceed to other static mappings or the R handler, http.port sets the port you want the HTTP server to listen on, qap=FALSE disables the otherwise default QAP protocol which you don?t use).
See Rserve documentation for additional options (e.g. TLS/SSL support, binding to all interfaces etc.). The static handers are experimental and undocumented, but can be given more love if people like them :).


> As for the limitations, IMHO when implemented as I did (Sys.sleep(Inf), setting path, and reset on exit), it behaves like most shiny apps I saw, or many apps in general.


But that is just a hack to prevent the user from entering the session - which is not how the server was designed (or R to be used, really).

I think what you want is not what you asked for - serving static files is something entirely different and it would be easy to add to R if that?s what you actually want and less controversial.

Simon

In order to judge the appetite for it I have included the support for custom handlers back then as inofficial API specifically so that if anyone cares we could work on refining it (really only Jeff and Hadley ever asked and/or provided feedback).

Firstly, normal R user does not expect http requests to mess with their analysis (e.g. changing the working directory would certainly not be welcome), so we don't want random code to execute and interfere with user's work. Secondly, http services are usually expected to be scalable and not interfere with each other - which is not possible directly here with the server as-is since it is fully serial within the user's session. What is truly desired strongly depends on the use-case: some applications would prefer a forked session for each connection, other may want co-operation in a separate environment. It is all doable, but beyond the scope of R's internal http server.

Subject: [Rd] Faster downloads: avoid them if possible
Message-ID: <CAN+W6_uPc6Fc+bWmiSXGJX8z44mG+JR_1oPGtLd-_9iX7uvDHg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R-devel,

I read with interest the recent blog post on how R will have parallel
downloads, on blog.r-project.org
(https://blog.r-project.org/2024/12/02/faster-downloads/index.html).
Thanks Tomas!

The blog mentions that one of the areas where this will be observed is
while installing them (which I did!). However, I noticed they might be
downloaded multiple times:
If one interrupts the install.packages (via Ctrl+C), or it fails due
to some system dependency missing and I fix that on a different
terminal session, or the internet connection is cut and I try again.

One possible way to make installations/downloads faster and also
reduce the bandwidth of repositories (and its mirrors) would be to
check if they need to be downloaded (again).
PACKAGES file on <repo>/src/contrib includes the MD5sum field that
could be used to check packages on the local folder (But it might be
faster to first check if any file exists there for the same package).

In short, I propose:
1) Checking before downloading packages their existence on the destdir
directory used by install.packages.
2) I suppose the most common scenario is to use install.packages with
the default destdir parameter (NULL). If 1) is implemented it might be
useful to keep the temporary directory common for a single R session.

I would appreciate feedback on these ideas.

Best,

Llu?s Revilla

PD: New users encountering download & installation issues often keep
seeing the progress bar (and in the future "trying URL 'https://...")
of the same packages. There are some ways to prevent/avoid repeated
downloads, such as, using the system library dependency resolver, or
having local mirrors. But they are not easy/available for new useRs,
and sometimes they are difficult to avoid (like having a reliable
internet connection).

Yes, and this has been the case before - it's not new for simultaneous 
downloads.

When destdir is NULL (the default), non-local packages are downloaded to 
a subdirectory of the temporary session directory (see 
?install.packages), so the downloaded files would be readily available 
to further installation attempts done by the same R session.

I think we could once extend download.file() to support re-use of 
already downloaded files, so that it can continue an interrupted 
download of a single file or re-use the whole file. This shouldn't be 
the default because the files in general may change between downloads, 
and may be even from different URLs, but it could be used by 
install.packages(), where this shouldn't happen, at least when destdir 
is NULL.? I think an extra round of checking checksums shouldn't be 
needed in install.packages().

Subject: [Rd] Is it advisable/possible to default on Linux to an EDITOR that
 actually exists?
Message-ID: <CAPRVBcxY_2jZkqtNepDRhLJXMRmgDC61jxYsDCBR2EyEX3e+5g@mail.gmail.com>

It looks like R has defaulted to using 'vi' for file.edit() (via
EDITOR since ~24 years ago[1][2].

These days I think it is much more common to write code from
lightweight environments, e.g. Docker files which strip all
unnecessary commands. On such machines, it is not safe to assume 'vi'
is installed, and it's not uncommon to encounter an issue like I did
again today[3] where you or some other tool call file.edit() directly
or implicitly and hit a clunky error.

Is there something better to do here? A "standard" Linux distribution
will come with vi, emacs, nano, probably many others. Should
`file.edit()` iterate over an ordered list to find the first that
exists? Should it at least error if
(!nzchar(Sys.which(Sys.getenv("EDITOR"))))?

Mike C

PS I do see some somewhat recent discussion[4] on EDITOR but it
focuses on the EDITOR default in non-interactive() sessions.

Michael,

This looks rather like a 'compile-time versus run-time' question to me. If
you look at etc/Renviron.in in the R sources you see a number of choices,
some of them with configure-time determined values (which I tend to override
with values for the Debian package).

For 'EDIT' it is

   ## Default editor
   EDITOR=${EDITOR-${VISUAL-vi}}

giving us two env vars to override eg in 'degenerate' situations such as the
forcefully minimized docker setup without other commands.

Otherwise, a generalization that would be possible might be to do something
similar to 'R CMD javareconf' to allow a later run-time call to affect the
encoded values---which would then be read at startup.  On the other hand,
environment variables already give customization so ...

Linux distributions can also have their mechanism. For example, Debian has
/etc/alternatives which for 'editor' defaults to nano even when vi, emacs,
mg, atom, code, ... are installed.  So you could also have the environment
variable EDITOR point to a script you control which then runs over possible
alternatives.

As for the conjecture 'it is much more common to write code from ...'  I
would love to see some empirics across a properly surveyed R user base. The
love of some power users for codespaces / devcontainers notwithstanding, 'the
most common' environment for writing R code is likely still what it always
was, a single windows desktop.

Anyway, thanks for raising this. I can look into making the Debian (and hence
Ubuntu) package switch to 'editor' over the vi fallback. 

Dirk

To quickly clarify, I mean "it is much more common to write code from
lightweight environments [now as compared to the year 2000 when the
EDITOR default was set to 'vi']". We agree about where most code is
written still today.

And yes, we can set VISUAL/EDITOR (as my personal .Rprofile does), but
doing something at run time still seems prudent. If I don't own the
Docker image, it's easy to forget this until we trip over file.edit()
much later. Onn the Docker image I use most often (for GitHub
Codespaces), there is no (command-line) editor by default -- VSCode
does the bulk of the work & I only install 'nano' to do things outside
the "current" repo. In short, there are very many ways EDITOR can wind
up un-set/incorrect.

Indeed, this behavior has been present before this recent change, the
post just reminded me to look into this.
The change described in the post will help when there is good internet
connections and this is the bottleneck.
My proposal could help those without good internet connection or other issues.

Perhaps the following test reinstalling the same package it is more
illustrative as we can see the package is downloaded again:

Note the progres bar to download the package even if there is already
present on destdir and the change on mtime on the folder showing the
updated hour.
By default install.packages uses a different temporary folder, set
internally which changes for each call which results in the same
behaviour: packages are downloaded again even if it's not needed
(there is no new BaseSet release between these two calls).

This would be great! I am sure it will have many uses beyond install.packages.

As you mentioned file download might change on the websites,
downloading the file again ensures they get the latest.
But if no new download occurs users could install an old version of a package.
That's why I suggested checking the downloaded files on destdir to
check the "cache" and download those that are stale.
If this is already solved in a different way (I couldn't find it on
install.packages source code) it would be great.

Michael,

vi is the only editor that is part of the POSIX standard. Embedded systems have built-in support only for vi (e.g., busybox) so if a system has any editor support at all it is  most likely to be vi - it is ubiquitous which is why it's the most logical default. (FWIW no distributions I know come with emacs by default because it's too heavy, but all come with vi).

If you use stripped-down images (obviously no longer standards-compliant) then you don't have any editor so it's moot. If you have preference for another editor then you should set EDITOR or VISUAL - it's just a default when neither the system nor user doesn't declare their preference. I don't think R should be fishing for random programs that may or may not be editors at run-time.

Cheers,
Simon

Thanks Simon, I didn't know that! That's definitely a compelling
reason to leave the current default untouched and to eschew any
finicky attempts to find back-up editors.

Still, I think there is benefit from checking quickly that 'editor'
exists at run-time in file.edit() -- the current failure mode is
unusual (a shell error & R warning). Offering an R error would also
benefit, e.g., users with a typo in their custom EDITOR setting:

$ EDITOR=eamcs R
> file.edit(tempfile())
# /bin/sh: line 1: eamcs: command not found
# Warning message:
# error in running command

Where I come up short is knowing the platform-robust way to implement
this -- nzchar(Sys.which(editor)) looks like it will work fine on
Unix, but I don't know what to do about macGUI/Windows.

Subject: [Rd] Check R version dependency in R CMD Check
Message-ID: <CA+6hu7eMvwn_BxHm_h6WXgZx979gQywUDPcbexgQJQtQ4dZqBw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have a server with R 3.6.3 installed and I struggled a bit with
updating several R packages that utilizes some new syntax introduced in R
4.1.0, such as the native pipe |> or function definition shorthand \(x) ...

The thing is that these packages states "Depends: R (>= 3.6.0)" and pass R
CMD Check without any issues. My problem occurred at the installation time.
I can see that developers naturally include the new handy syntax but
oftentimes forget to raise R version dependency in their DESCRIPTIONs.
Should we employ some new checks?

Best,
Jan

I?ve been guilty of this myself. I think a check would be good.

In my case I was using the new sort_by() function (I think also 4.1) and a
user was failing to install on R 4.0.

I am not sure I agree with the fairly bold statement by Simon. I do not
install or use that many different Unix flavours but I do come across some
that do not, by default, install vi

  $ docker run --rm -ti debian bash
  root at 54d4be543766:/# vi
  bash: vi: command not found
  root at 54d4be543766:/#
  root at 54d4be543766:/# nano
  bash: nano: command not found
  exit
  $ 

Distributions may have defined sets of packages deemed 'essential', editors
do not seem to be part of that here.

Anyway, when you are calling edit(), or call a function calling edit() you
can always override appropriately with both an environment variable or an R
option so this all seems like a nothingburger to me.  "If on systems that
don't have all tools, maybe don't call functions from package `usethis`"
(which makes reasonable assumptions about what could be present) also seems
like a valid strategy.

For package authors using Github Action, one reason why they forget to
actually check their packages against the minimal R version specified
in DESCRIPTION may be the use of _relative_ versions in the workflows
like this: https://github.com/r-lib/actions/blob/v2/examples/check-full.yaml
i.e., checking against the 5 last minor releases of R (and this
example workflow says even 5 is likely to be an overkill and
recommends people to test only one old release instead). As a result,
as R makes new releases, packages will not be tested against older
versions of R anymore and package authors won't notice it.

Speaking of guilt, someone has a package that states `Depends: R (>=
3.6.0)` (by coincidence):
https://github.com/yihui/knitr/blob/master/DESCRIPTION#L117 but it's
only checked against R >= 4.0.x (oldrel-4) at the moment:
https://github.com/yihui/knitr/blob/master/.github/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml#L41

To ensure the package is checked against the minimal R version and
above, we'd have to enumerate all version numbers like this:
https://github.com/yihui/litedown/blob/main/.github/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml#L19-L29
And this list needs to be updated after each new release of R.

I'm not sure if Jan was proposing to CRAN or package authors for such
checks, but I feel this is primarily the responsibility of package
authors.

Regards,
Yihui
