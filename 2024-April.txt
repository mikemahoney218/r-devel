I have just added R-4-4-branch to the feeds.  I think I've also fixed 
the \I issue, so today's news includes a long list of old changes.

Now 745 -- and the bigger issue seems to be that the 'posted at' timestamp is
wrong and 'current' so all the old posts are now seen as 'fresh'. Hence the
flood ... of unsorted post.

blosxom, simple as it is, takes (IIRC) filesystem ctime as the posting
timestamp so would be best if you had a backup with the old timestamps.

Many thanks Duncan,
I tried to look into the code but didn't manage to advance much due to some
java configuration issues.

To prevent being flooded by content of old versions I added a filter to
only repost those that the release version of the branch is in the title of
the content.
Maybe this would be helpful to avoid publishing the full NEWS again.

Looks like those dates are gone -- the switch from svn to git involved 
some copying, and I didn't preserve timestamps.

I'll see about regenerating the more recent ones.  I don't think there's 
much historical interest in the pre-4.0 versions, so maybe I'll just 
nuke those.

You can recreate them. Nobody cares too much about the hour or minute with a
day as there (always ? generally ?) was only one post per day.  But preserving
the overall sort order would be nice as would not spamming the recent posts
with old ones.

I suspect you will have to do it programmatically too. You could even take
the old timestamps of the svn and/or git commits and then touch the ctime (or
maybe it was mtime, I forget but 'touch --time=....  file' works). "Been
there done that" for part of my 20+ year old blog infrastructure too.

Duncan,

I have fixed up the repo with git restore-mtime -- I think that should solve it - please check if it did what we needed.

Cheers,

Subject: [Rd] Bug in out-of-bounds assignment of list object to expression()
 vector
Message-ID: <CAH54GbXMhcy+JFV7dfBLV0J7+YVoTBB8zdnQqEhrOogZPnM-yQ@mail.gmail.com>

There seems to be a bug in out-of-bounds assignment of list objects to an
expression() vector. Tested on release and devel. (Many thanks to folks
over at Mastodon for the help narrowing down this bug)

When assigning a list into an existing index, it correctly errors on
incompatible type, and the expression vector is unchanged:

```
x <- expression(a,b,c)
x[[3]] <- list() # Error
x
#> expression(a, b, c)
```

When assigning a list to an out of bounds index (ex: the next, n+1 index),
it errors the same but now changes the values of the vector to NULL:

```
x <- expression(a,b,c)
x[[4]] <- list() # Error
x
#> expression(NULL, NULL, NULL)
```

Curiously, this behavior disappears if a prior attempt is made at assigning
to the same index, using a different incompatible object that does not
share this bug (like a function):

```
x <- expression(a,b,c)
x[[4]] <- base::sum # Error
x[[4]] <- list() # Error
x
#> expression(a, b, c)
```

That "protection" persists until x[[4]] is evaluated, at which point the
bug can be produced again:

```
x[[4]] # Error
x[[4]] <- list() # Error
x
#> expression(NULL, NULL, NULL)
```

Note that `x` has remained a 3-length vector throughout.

Best,
June

Here's how the problem happens:

1. The call lands in src/main/subassign.c, do_subassign2_dflt().

2. do_subassign2_dflt() calls SubassignTypeFix() to prepare the operand
for the assignment.

3. Since the assignment is "stretching", SubassignTypeFix() calls
EnlargeVector() to provide the space for the assignment.

The bug relies on `x` not being IS_GROWABLE(), which may explain 
why a plain x[[4]] <- list() sometimes doesn't fail.

The future assignment result `x` is now expression(a, b, c, NULL), and
the old `x` set to expression(NULL, NULL, NULL) by SET_VECTOR_ELT(newx,
i, VECTOR_ELT(x, i)); CLEAR_VECTOR_ELT(x, i); during EnlargeVector().

4. But then the assignment fails, raising the error back in
do_subassign2_dflt(), because the assignment kind is invalid: there is
no way to put data.frames into an expression vector. The new resized
`x` is lost, and the old overwritten `x` stays there.

Not sure what the right way to fix this is. It's desirable to avoid
shallow_duplicate(x) for the overwriting assignments, but then the
sub-assignment must either succeed or leave the operand untouched.
Is there a way to perform the type check before overwriting the operand?

Yes, definitely looks like a bug.

Are you able to submit it to bugs.r-project.org?

Yes. There are two places where there are some checks, one early and
the other late. The early one is explicitly letting this one through
and shouldn't. So a one line change would address this particular
problem. But it would be a good idea to review why we the late checks
are needed at all and maybe change that. I'll look into it.

Thanks all for looking into this.

Unfortunately I don't know my way around Bugzilla and I'm a bit occupied
for the next few days - it would be great if a bug report could be opened
on my behalf.

Thanks for the report. Fixed in R-devel and R-patched (both
R-4-4-branch and R-4-3-branch).

Subject: [Rd] Repeated library() of one package with different include.only=
 entries
Message-ID: <CAPRVBcy8u+2K+4Gw=FnYqt5We-qwPVuA0QDoOCmSAcqaJs1_EQ@mail.gmail.com>

Right now, attaching the same package with different include.only= has no
effect:

library(Matrix, include.only="fac2sparse")
library(Matrix)
ls("package:Matrix")
# [1] "fac2sparse"

?library does not cover this case -- what is covered is the _loading_
behavior of repeated calls:

> [library and require] check and update the list of currently attached
packages and do not reload a namespace which is already loaded

But here we're looking at the _attach_ behavior of repeated calls.

I am particularly interested in allowing the exports of a package to be
built up gradually:

library(Matrix, include.only="fac2sparse")
library(Matrix, include.only="isDiagonal") # want: ls("package:Matrix") -->
c("fac2sparse", "isDiagonal")
...

It seems quite hard to accomplish this at the moment. Is the behavior to
ignore new inclusions intentional? Could there be an argument to get
different behavior?

Dear Henrik (and everyone else):

Here's a patch implementing support for immediateConditions in
'parallel' socket clusters. What do you think?

I've tried to make the feature backwards-compatible in the sense that
an older R starting a newer cluster worker will not pass the flag
enabling condition passing and so will avoid being confused by packets
with type = 'CONDITION'.

In order to propagate the conditions in a timely manner, all 'parallel'
functions that currently use recvData() on individual nodes will have
to switch to calling recvOneData(). I've already adjusted
staticClusterApply(), but e.g. clusterCall() would still postpone
immediateConditions from nodes later in the list (should they appear).

If this is deemed a good way forward, I can prepare a similar patch for
the MPI and socket clusters implemented in the 'snow' package.

Ivan

As you did not get an answer yet, ..., some remarks by an
R-corer who has tweaked library() behavior in the past :

- The `include.only = *` argument to library() has been a
  *relatively* recent addition {given the 25+ years of R history}:

  It was part of the extensive new features by Luke Tierney for
  R 3.6.0  [r76248 | luke | 2019-03-18 17:29:35 +0100], with NEWS entry

    ? library() and require() now allow more control over handling
      search path conflicts when packages are attached. The policy is
      controlled by the new conflicts.policy option.

- I haven't seen these (then) new features been used much, unfortunately,
  also not from R-core members, but I'd be happy to be told a different story.
  

For the above reasons, it could well be that the current
implementation {of these features} has not been exercised a lot
yet, and limitations as you found them haven't been noticed yet,
or at least not noticed on the public R mailing lists, nor
otherwise by R-core (?).

Your implicitly proposed new feature (or even *changed*
default behavior) seems to make sense to me -- but as alluded
to, above, I haven't been a conscious user of any
'library(.., include.only = *)' till now.

I don't think it makes sense.  I would assume that

   library(Matrix, include.only="isDiagonal")

implies that only `isDiagonal` ends up on the search path, i.e. 
"include.only" means "include only", not "include in addition to 
whatever else has already been attached".

I think a far better approach to solve Michael's problem is simply to use

   fac2sparse <- Matrix::fac2sparse
   isDiagonal <- Matrix::isDiagonal

instead of messing around with the user's search list, which may have 
been intentionally set to include only one of those.

So I'd suggest changing the docs to say

"[library and require] check and update the list of currently attached
packages and do not reload a namespace which is already loaded.  If a 
package is already attached, no change will be made."

?library could also mention using detach() followed by library() or
attachNamespace() with a new include.only specification.

This could also be a reasonable behavior, but neither does that happen
today.

This does not fully simulate attachment, e.g. running package hooks &
resolving Depends.

> attachNamespace() with a new include.only specification.

This is the "quite hard to accomplish" I alluded to, admittedly I hadn't
forced myself to write it all out -- maybe it's not as bad as all that.
After some iterations, today I think we'd want to do...

modify_attach = function(pkg, new_names) {
  if (!startsWith(pkg, "package:")) pkg <- paste0("package:", pkg)
  old <- tryCatch(ls(pkg, all.names=TRUE), error=\(c) character())
  if (length(old)) detach(pkg)
  attachNamespace(.rmpkg(pkg), include.only=c(new_names, old))
}

Perhaps detach() could invisibly return the exported names to make this a
tiny bit easier (today it returns NULL):

modify_attach = function(pkg, new_names) {
  if (!startsWith(pkg, "package:")) pkg <- paste0("package:", pkg)
  old <- tryCatch(detach(pkg), error=\(c) character())
  attachNamespace(.rmpkg(pkg), include.only=c(new_names, old))
}

Regardless, I think your suggestion to just point to
detach()+attachNamespace() is reasonable enough, the rare users that care
about this are likely to be able to figure out the rest from there.

Subject: [Rd] Calling applyClosure from a package?
Message-ID: <CAPa38nEZWsAc_7-NDLZ4eRfEVRj-qvXPOw2ND5_VCwEkxLCA7g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Short version of my question: Rf_applyClosure was marked
attribute_hidden in Oct 2023, and I am curious why and if there is an
alternative interface to it planned.

Long version:

I have been toying with building a package that makes it easier to do
non-standard evaluation directly using promises, rather than wrapping
these in a custom type (like e.g. rlang does). The advantage of this
approach is that it should be fully compatible with functions that use
the standard R functions for NSE and inspecting function context, like
substitute(), match.call(), or parent.frame(). And indeed, it works!
-- in R 4.3, that is. The prototype version of the package is here:
https://github.com/mjskay/uneval  (the relevant function to my
question is probably do_invoke, in R/invoke.R).

While testing on R-devel, I noticed that Rf_applyClosure(), which used
to be exported, is now marked with attribute_hidden. I traced the
change to this commit in Oct 2023:
https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/commit/57dbe8ad471c8a34314ee74362ad479db03c033a

However, the commit message did not give me clarity on the reason for
the change, and I have not been able to find mention of this change in
R-devel, R-package-devel, or the R bug tracker.
So, I am curious why this function is no longer exported and if there
is an alternative function planned to take its place.

Neither Rf_eval nor do.call can do what I need to fully support
rlang-style NSE using base R. The problem is that I need to be able to
manually set up the list of promises provided as arguments to the
function.

I fully understand that the answer to my question might be "don't do
that" ;). But I will humbly suggest that it would be really nice to be
able to do NSE that can capture expressions with heterogeneous
environments and pass these to functions in a way that is compatible
with existing R functions that do NSE. The basic tools to do it are
there in R 4.3, I think...

Thanks for the help!

applyClosure has never been part of the API and was/is not intended
for use by packages. Keeping things like this internal is essential to
give us flexibility to make needed improvements to the basic engine.
Moving this out of the installed headers and marking it as not to be
exported merely clarifies that it is internal.

That would be my advice: Don't do that. The API does not provide an
interface for working with promises; in fact the existence of promises
is not guaranteed in the future. Some packages have unfortunately made
use of some internal functions related to promises. For the ones on
CRAN we will work with the maintainers to find alternate
approaches. This may mean adding some functions to the API for dealing
with some lazy-evaluation-related features at a higher level.

Best,

I think we should try to advance and hopefully finalize this
thread before we forget about it ..

Indeed; I think we should signal a warning at least in the case
it does not happen --- namely when "parts of Matrix" are already
in the search path.

(indeed; as library() is really about search() patch attchment)

I agree that such changed detach() behavior would be "nice" here;
but I wouldn't like to change its default behavior, notably as
in 99.5% of its use, the names would not be used.
I'd agree to add a new option for detach() to return the names
(visibly in that case).

So I think we agree here;  mentioning such a modify_attach()
... I'd use an example *without* tryCatch() as I think the user
    should choose their own line of action in such cases
...
on the help page would then be appropriate.

OK, I've moved your suggestions into the tracker for further discussion:

https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18703
https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18704
https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18705

I will tackle a patch for 18705 to start with as the lowest-hanging fruit.

Dear R-developers,

I came to a somewhat unexpected behaviour of read.csv() which is trivial but worthwhile to note -- my data involves a protein named "1433E" but to save space I drop the quote so it becomes,

Gene,SNP,prot,log10p
YWHAE,13:62129097_C_T,1433E,7.35
YWHAE,4:72617557_T_TA,1433E,7.73

Both read.cv() and readr::read_csv() consider prot(ein) name as (possibly confused by scientific notation) numeric 1433 which only alerts me when I tried to combine data,

all_data <- data.frame()
for (protein in proteins[1:7])
{
   cat(protein,":\n")
   f <- paste0(protein,".csv")
   if(file.exists(f))
   {
     p <- read.csv(f)
     print(p)
     if(nrow(p)>0) all_data  <- bind_rows(all_data,p)
   }
}

proteins[1:7]
[1] "1433B" "1433E" "1433F" "1433G" "1433S" "1433T" "1433Z"

dplyr::bind_rows() failed to work due to incompatible types nevertheless rbind() went ahead without warnings.

Best wishes,


Jing Hua

You may need to reconsider aiding read.csv() (and alternate reading
functions) by supplying column-type info instead of relying on educated
heuristic guesses which appear to fail here due to the nature of your data.

Other storage formats can store type info. That is generally safer and may be
an option too.

I think this was more of an email for r-help than r-devel.

Hello,

I wrote a file with that content and read it back with


read.csv("filename.csv", as.is = TRUE)


There were no problems, it all worked as expected.

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Hum...

This boils down to

> as.numeric("1.23e")
[1] 1.23
> as.numeric("1.23e-")
[1] 1.23
> as.numeric("1.23e+")
[1] 1.23

which in turn comes from this code in src/main/util.c (function R_strtod)

    if (*p == 'e' || *p == 'E') {
        int expsign = 1;
        switch(*++p) {
        case '-': expsign = -1;
        case '+': p++;
        default: ;
        }
        for (n = 0; *p >= '0' && *p <= '9'; p++) n = (n < MAX_EXPONENT_PREFIX) ? n * 10 + (*p - '0') : n;
        expn += expsign * n;
    }

which sets the exponent to zero even if the for loop terminates immediately.  

This might qualify as a bug, as it differs from the C function strtod which accepts

"A sequence of digits, optionally containing a decimal-point character (.), optionally followed by an exponent part (an e or E character followed by an optional sign and a sequence of digits)."

[Of course, there would be nothing to stop e.g. "1433E1" from being converted to numeric.]

What platform are you on?  I got the same output as Jing Hua:

Input filename.csv:

As an aside, the odd format does not seem to bother data.table::fread() which
also happens to be my personally preferred workhorse for these tasks:

That's on Linux, everything current but dev version of data.table.

   Tangentially, your code will be more efficient if you add the data 
files to a *list* one by one and then apply bind_rows or 
do.call(rbind,...) after you have accumulated all of the information 
(see chapter 2 of the _R Inferno_). This may or may not be practically 
important in your particular case.

Gene names being misinterpreted by spreadsheet software (read.csv is
no different) is a classic issue in bioinformatics. It seems like
every practitioner ends up encountering this issue in due time. E.g.

I'm posting here instead of R-package since your response
was the most relevant :) I started using the "in-situ" workflow
and its very nice.  Thew viewer stays up between runs and across
data sources and its the same UI regardless of source :) 
fwiw. 

I started digging through some noisy data, dog diet data
in which the supplements were pulsed ( in essence PWM lol).
This made it hard to find the right average doses to correlate
with outcomes. I had to play with trailing average filtering but
ultimately some trends emerged that made sense with
subjective observations ( maybe they are not real but that is
not the point of this post ).

I did not use R or Visit but  I used my own code 
for filtering and MJMDatascope for viewing and expect
to do more sophisticated stuff in R soon. I can tell you
though that eliminating the annoyance and confusion of
temp files was very helpful. The workflow, and mind flow,
for the "in situ" mode makes you wonder how you ever did without
it. I will probably need to update my R interface package and
MJMDatascope is hardly ideal but improving both seems
worth the effort.

Thanks.

At ORNL, we worked with VisIt (a sibling of Paraview, both funded largely by DOE) around 2016 and made an in situ demo with R. We used packages pbdMPI (on CRAN) and pbdDMAT (on GitHub/RbigData), which were in part built for this purpose. Later also the package hola (on GitHub/RbigData) was built to connect with adios2, which can do buffered in situ connections with various codes.

But the VisIt developers were not interested in R (preferring to roll their own), so that direction fizzled. Paraview is a competetive sibling of VisIt, so I don?t know if they would be interested. The packages we developed are viable for that purpose. There is a lot in R that could benefit Paraview (or VisIt).

Subject: [Rd] Is ALTREP "non-API"?
Message-ID: <CALyqOb8VS+z-1c4r-NAGvg9EfTgSL_1MqbQkSWb+7jQZdJWQ1Q@mail.gmail.com>

Writing R Extension[1] defines "API" as:

    Entry points which are documented in this manual and declared in an
installed header file. These can be used in distributed packages and will
only be changed after deprecation.

But, the document (WRE) doesn't have even a single mention of ALTREP, the
term "ALTREP" itself or any entry points related to ALTREP. Does this mean,
despite the widespread use of it on R packages including CRAN ones, ALTREP
is not the API and accordingly using it in distributed packages is
considered illegal?

Best,
Yutani
