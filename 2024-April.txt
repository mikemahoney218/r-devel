I have just added R-4-4-branch to the feeds.  I think I've also fixed 
the \I issue, so today's news includes a long list of old changes.

Now 745 -- and the bigger issue seems to be that the 'posted at' timestamp is
wrong and 'current' so all the old posts are now seen as 'fresh'. Hence the
flood ... of unsorted post.

blosxom, simple as it is, takes (IIRC) filesystem ctime as the posting
timestamp so would be best if you had a backup with the old timestamps.

Many thanks Duncan,
I tried to look into the code but didn't manage to advance much due to some
java configuration issues.

To prevent being flooded by content of old versions I added a filter to
only repost those that the release version of the branch is in the title of
the content.
Maybe this would be helpful to avoid publishing the full NEWS again.

Looks like those dates are gone -- the switch from svn to git involved 
some copying, and I didn't preserve timestamps.

I'll see about regenerating the more recent ones.  I don't think there's 
much historical interest in the pre-4.0 versions, so maybe I'll just 
nuke those.

You can recreate them. Nobody cares too much about the hour or minute with a
day as there (always ? generally ?) was only one post per day.  But preserving
the overall sort order would be nice as would not spamming the recent posts
with old ones.

I suspect you will have to do it programmatically too. You could even take
the old timestamps of the svn and/or git commits and then touch the ctime (or
maybe it was mtime, I forget but 'touch --time=....  file' works). "Been
there done that" for part of my 20+ year old blog infrastructure too.

Duncan,

I have fixed up the repo with git restore-mtime -- I think that should solve it - please check if it did what we needed.

Cheers,
