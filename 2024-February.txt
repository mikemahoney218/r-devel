Subject: [Rd] [Feature Request] Hide API Key in download.file() / R's libcurl
Message-ID: <CAOmDYzZe2ODCqgK+9sOtAAh1dVpAKK=PT7h7bs12cAFzk+ckMg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

When trying to install a package from R using install.packages(), it will
print out the full url address (of the remote repository) it was trying to
access. A bit further digging shows it is from the in_do_curlDownload
method from R's libcurl
<https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/trunk/src/modules/internet/libcurl.c>:
install.packages() calls download.packages(), and download.packages() calls
download.file(), which uses "libcurl" as its default method.

This line from R mirror
<https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/trunk/src/modules/internet/libcurl.c#L772>
("if (!quiet) REprintf(_("trying URL '%s'\n"), url);")  prints the full url
it is trying to access.

This is totally fine for public urls without credentials, but in the case
that a given url contains an API key, it poses security issues. For
example, if the getOption("repos") has been overridden to a
customized repository (protected by API keys), then
> install.packages("zoo")
Installing packages into '--removed local directory path--'
trying URL 'https://--removed userid--:--removed
api-key-- at repository-addresss.com:4443/.../src/contrib/zoo_1.8-12.tar.gz  '
Content type 'application/x-gzip' length 782344 bytes (764 KB)
===================================
downloaded 764 KB

* installing *source* package 'zoo' ...
-- further logs removed --
>

I also tried several other options:

1. quite=1
> install.packages("zoo", quite=1)
It did hide the url, but it also hid all other useful information.
2. method="curl"
> install.packages("zoo", method="curl")
This does not print the url when the download is successful, but if there
were any errors, it still prints the url with API key in it.
3. method="wget"
> install.packages("zoo", method="wget")
This hides API key by *password*, but I wasn't able to install packages
with this method even with public repos, with the error "Warning: unable to
access index for repository https://cloud.r-project.org/src/contrib/4.3:
'wget' call had nonzero exit status"


In other dynamic languages' package managers like Python's pip, API keys
are hidden by default since pip 18.x in 2018, and masked by "****" from pip
19.x in 2019, see below examples. Can we get a similar default behaviour in
R?

1. with pip 10.x
$ pip install numpy -v # API key was not hided
Looking in indexes:  https://--removed userid--:--removed
api-key-- at repository-addresss.com:4443/.../pypi/simple
2. with pip 18.x # All credentials are removed by pip
$ pip install numpy -v
Looking in indexes:  https://repository-addresss.com:4443/
.../pypi/simple
3. with pip 19.x onwards # userid is kept, API key is replaced by ****
$ pip install numpy -v
Looking in indexes:  https://userid:****@
repository-addresss.com:4443/.../pypi/simple


I was instructed by https://www.r-project.org/bugs.html that I should get
some discussion on r-devel before filing a feature request. So looking
forward to comments/suggestions.

Thanks,
Xinyi

I've just been reading 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication, and it 
states that putting userid:password in the URL is deprecated, but it 
does make sense that R should protect users who still use that scheme.

Any reason why you didn't use quiet=TRUE to suppress that output?

There is no official API structure for credentials in R repositories, so R has no way of knowing which part of the URL are credentials as it is not under R's purview - it could be part of the path or anything, so there is no way R can reliably mask it. Hence it makes more sense for the user to suppress the output if they think it may contain sensitive information - and R supports that.

If that's still not enough, then please make a concrete proposal that defines exactly what kind processing you'd like to see under what conditions - and how you think that will solve the problem.

Cheers,
Simon

Hi,

I just ran into this 'R CMD check' NOTE for the first time:

* checking R code for possible problems ... NOTE
toto: multiple local function definitions for ?fun? with different
 ? formal arguments

The "offending" code is something like this (simplified from the real code):

toto <- function(mode)
{
 ??? if (mode == 1)
 ??????? fun <- function(a, b) a*b
 ??? else
 ??????? fun <- function(u, v, w) (u + v) / w
 ??? fun
}

Is that NOTE really intended? Hard to see why this code would be 
considered "wrong".

I know it's just a NOTE but still...

Thanks,

H.

Well you can see that yeast is exactly weekday you have.  The way out is to just not name the result

toto <- function(mode)
{
    ifelse(mode == 1,
        function(a,b) a*b,
        function(u, v, w) (u + v) / w)
}

I think something happened to your explanation...

It's a bad idea to use ifelse() when you really want if() ... else ... . 
  In this case it works, but it doesn't always.  So the workaround should be


toto <- function(mode)
{
     if(mode == 1)
         function(a,b) a*b
     else
         function(u, v, w) (u + v) / w
}

I agree it's a false positive, but the issue is that you have a function 
object in your function which can't be called unconditionally.  The 
workaround doesn't create such an object.

Recognizing that your function never tries to call fun requires global 
inspection of toto(), and most of the checks are based on local inspection.

or is there something else?

a) Use the 'mac builder' CRAN offers:
   https://mac.r-project.org/macbuilder/submit.html 

b) Use the newly added M1 runners at GitHub Actions,
   https://github.blog/changelog/2024-01-30-github-actions-introducing-the-new-m1-macos-runner-available-to-open-source/

Option a) is pretty good as the machine is set up for CRAN and builds
fast. Option b) gives you more control should you need it.

Slightly tangential: I had some woes with some vignettes in my
optimx and nlsr packages (actually in examples comparing to OTHER
packages) because the M? processors don't have 80 bit registers of
the old IEEE 754 arithmetic, so some existing "tolerances" are too
small when looking to see if is small enough to "converge", and one
gets "did not converge" type errors. There are workarounds,
but the discussion is beyond this post. However, worth awareness that
the code may be mostly correct except for appropriate tests of
smallness for these processors.

I think I had that problem with the minimaxApprox package as well.

Hi John.

I don't think the 80 bit format was part of IEEE 754; I think it was an 
Intel invention for the 8087 chip (which I believe preceded that 
standard), and didn't make it into the standard.

The standard does talk about 64 bit and 128 bit floating point formats, 
but not 80 bit.

For cases like these, I think it would be more useful to have some
mechanism for associating URLs / hosts with credentials, and have R use
those credentials by default whenever accessing those URLs. Since
download.file() now supports custom headers, this could be a mechanism for
setting headers to be used by default when downloading files from
particular URLs. Then, users could do something like:

    options(download.file.headers = list(
        example.org = c(Authorization = "<...>")
    ))

And those headers would be used automatically by download.file() whenever
talking to that server.

All of that to say -- I think the better way forward would be to make it
easier to safely use authentication credentials in download.file(), rather
than just tooling in support for suppressing specific types of output.

Best,
Kevin

R has no way of knowing which part of the URL are credentials as it is not
under R's purview - it could be part of the path or anything, so there is
no way R can reliably mask it. Hence it makes more sense for the user to
suppress the output if they think it may contain sensitive information -
and R supports that.

80 bit registers (I don't have my original docs with me here in Victoria)
seem to have been part of the 1985 standard to which I was one of the 31 named
contributors. See

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/612507/what-are-the-applications-benefits-of-an-80-bit-extended-precision-data-type

or the Wikipedia item on IEEE 754.

It appears to have been omitted from 2008 and 2020 versions, but is still (I believe) part of
many processors. It's an internal precision for handling multiplications and accumulation,
and not one of the storage modes.

Most of the time this makes very little difference in results for R, since it is only some
operations where the extended precision gets activated. If we store quantities, we get the
regular precision. Thus very few situations using the M? chips give differences, but when
they do, it is a nuisance.

There is plenty of scope for debating the pros and cons of extended precision internally.
Not having it likely contributes to speed / bang for the buck of the M? chips. But we do
now have occasional differences in outcomes which will lead to confusion and extra work.

Yes, the 80 bit was Intel-specific (motivated by internal operations, not as external format), but as it used to be most popular architecture, people didn't quite realize that tests relying on Intel results will be Intel-specific (PowerPC Macs had 128-bit floating point, but they were not popular enough to cause trouble in the same way). The IEEE standard allows "extended precision" formats, but doesn't prescribe their format or precision - and they are optional. Arm64 CPUs only support 64-bit double precision in hardware (true both on macOS and Windows), so only what is in the basic standard. There are 128-bit floating point solutions in software, but, obviously, they are a lot slower (several orders of magnitude). Apple has been asking for priorities in the scientific community and 128-bit floating number support was not something high on people's priority list. It is far from trivial, because there is a long list of operations (all variations of the math functions) so I wouldn't expect this to change anytime soon - in fact once Microsoft's glacial move is done we'll be likely seeing only 64-bit everywhere.

That said even if you don't have a arm64 CPU, you can build R with --disable-long-double to get closer to the arm64 results if that is your worry.

Cheers,
Simon

Simon's comments add another viewpoint to mine. My own knowledge of the
impact of "disable-long-double" does not include an understanding of
exactly what effect this has. One needs to spend a lot of time and effort
with excruciating details. Fortunately, we can usually get away with
64 bit FP arithmetic for almost all applications. I suspect applications
that need really long precision are likely best handled with special
hardware.

He wrote 'quite' instead of 'quiet' {see cited below '1. quite=1'}

Apologies for the typo in my original email. I meant ?quiet=1? and it was
working. The log was typed but not copied so that was why there was a typo.

But as stated in the reasoning - it hides all the output, so also other
useful information like where the lib is installed, compile details etc.
which will be useful for debugging. I.e. quiet=1 can be a workaround but
not a real solution.

I would know it was typo if I have only tried quite? As it would print
error telling me ?quite? is not recognised ;)

Cheers,
Xinyi

Apologies for not answering the question you asked, but is this about
hdf5r and problems printing R_xlen_t [*] that appeared in 1.3.8 and you
tried to solve in 1.3.9?

We had a thread about this last November:
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-package-devel/2023q4/010123.html

To summarise, there is no single standard C format specifier that can be
used to print R_xlen_t. As an implementation detail, it can be defined
as int or ptrdiff_t (or something completely different in the future),
and ptrdiff_t itself is usually defined as long or long long (or, also,
something completely different on a weirder platform). All three basic
types can have different widths and cause painful stack-related
problems when a mismatch happens.

In R-4.4, there will be a macro R_PRIdXLEN_T defining a compatible
printf specifier. Until then (and for compatibility with R-4.3 and
lower), it's relatively safe to cast to (long long) or (ptrdiff_t) and
then use the corresponding specifier, but that's not 100% future-proof.
Also, mind the warnings that mingw compilers sometimes emit for "new"
printf specifiers despite UCRT is documented to support them.

I presumed this was about a CRAN package, possibly hdf5r which has a 
R-devel-only warning from the Apple clang compiler.  And that is not a 
'check error' and not something to 'debug'.

The original poster had errors for his package flsa until yesterday on 
fedora-clang and M1mac, which were compilation errors with recent LLVM 
and Apple compilers.  Again, not really something to 'debug' -- the 
compiler messages were clear and the CRAN notification contained advice 
on where in our manual to look this up.

The mac-builder service offers checks for R 4.3.0, the 'development' 
option being (last time I tried) the same as the 'release' option. (When 
I asked, Simon said that 'development' checks were only available in the 
run up to a x.y.0 when he starts package building and checks for R-devel.)


We were left to guess, but I doubt this has to do with the lack of 
'extended precision' nor long doubles longer than doubles on arm64 
macOS.  And issues with that are rather rare (much rarer than numerical 
issues for non-reference x86_64 BLAS/LAPACKs).  Of the 20,300 CRAN 
packages just 18 have M1mac-specific errors, none obviously from 
numerical inaccuracy.  A quick look back suggests we get about 20 a year 
with M1mac numerical issues, about half of which were mirrored on the 
x86_64 'noLD' checks.

M1mac numerical issues should be rare, but when they do pop up they can be disconcerting.

The following little script reveals what happens with no extended precision. A few months
ago I built this into a "package" and used https://mac.r-project.org/macbuilder/submit.html
to run it, getting the indicated result of 0 for (sum(vv1) - 1.0e0), with non-zero on my
Ryzen 7 laptop.

JN

# FPExtendedTest.R   J C Nash
loopsum <- function(vec){
    n <- length(vec)
    vsum<-0.0
    for (i in 1:n) { vsum <- vsum + vec[i]}
    vsum
}
small<-.Machine$double.eps/4 # 1/4 of the machine precision
vsmall <- rep(small, 1e4) # a long vector of small numbers
vv1 <- c(1.0, vsmall) # 1 at the front of this vector
vv2 <- c(vsmall, 1.0) # 1 at the end
(sum(vv1) - 1.0e0) # Should be > 0 for extended precision, 0 otherwise
(sum(vv2) - 1.0e0) # Should be > 0
(loopsum(vv1) - 1.0e0) # should be zero
(loopsum(vv2) - 1.0e0) # should be greater than zero

Thanks. Workarounds are interesting but... what's the point of the NOTE

Thanks. Workarounds are interesting but... what's the point of the NOTE in the first place?

Hi,

I just ran into this 'R CMD check' NOTE for the first time:

* checking R code for possible problems ... NOTE
toto: multiple local function definitions for ?fun? with different
   formal arguments

The "offending" code is something like this (simplified from the real code):

toto <- function(mode)
{
     if (mode == 1)
         fun <- function(a, b) a*b
     else
         fun <- function(u, v, w) (u + v) / w
     fun
}

Is that NOTE really intended? Hard to see why this code would be
considered "wrong".

I know it's just a NOTE but still...

I agree it's a false positive, but the issue is that you have a function object in your function which can't be called unconditionally.  The workaround doesn't create such an object.

Recognizing that your function never tries to call fun requires global inspection of toto(), and most of the checks are based on local inspection.

Because functions get called and therefore, the calling sequence matters. It?s just protecting you from yourself, but as someone pointed out, there?s a way to silence such notes.

Sure I get that. But how is that any different from a variable being defined in two different ways like in

    if (mode == 1)
        x <- -8
    else
        x <- 55

This is such a common and perfectly fine pattern. Why would this be considered a potential hazard when the variable is a function?

Creating a function that can't be called could be an error.  Presumably 
you are careful and never try to call it with the wrong signature, but 
the check code isn't smart enough to follow every code path, so it gives 
the note to warn you that you might have something wrong.

You still have the same issue with my workaround, but the check code 
isn't smart enough to notice that.

Here's a dummy example that I think illustrates the problem:

toto <- function() {
  if (runif(1) < 0.5)
    function(a) a
  else
    function(a,b) a+b
}

> fcn <- toto()
> fcn(1,2)
[1] 3
> fcn <- toto()
> fcn(1,2)
[1] 3
> fcn <- toto()
> fcn(1,2)
Error in fcn(1, 2) : unused argument (2)

How can you use the returned function, if you get different arguments?

In your example, you cannot use the returned function without knowing
'mode', or by inspecting the returned function.  So, the warning is
there to alert you to a potential bug.  Anecdotally, I'm pretty sure
this R CMD check NOTE has caught at least one such bug in one of
my/our packages.

If you want to keep the current design pattern, one approach could be
to add ... to your function definitions:

toto <- function(mode)
{
     if (mode == 1)
         fun <- function(a, b, ...) a*b
     else
         fun <- function(u, v, w) (u + v) / w
     fun
}

to make sure that toto() returns functions that accept the same
minimal number of arguments.

message "should not be called with handlers on the stack".  A much 
simpler illustration of the same error comes from this line:

   try(globalCallingHandlers(warning = function(e) e))

The problem here is that try() sets an error handler, and 
globalCallingHandlers() sees it and aborts.

If I call globalCallingHandlers() with no arguments, I get a list of 
currently active global handlers.  Is there also a way to get a list of 
active handlers, including non-global ones (like the one try() added in 
the line above)?

I went looking and found this in codetools, where it's been for 20 years

https://gitlab.com/luke-tierney/codetools/-/blame/master/R/codetools.R?ref_type=heads#L951

I think the call stack in codetools is checkUsagePackage -> checkUsageEnv -> checkUsage, and these are similarly established. The call from the tools package https://github.com/wch/r-source/blame/95146f0f366a36899e4277a6a722964a51b93603/src/library/tools/R/QC.R#L4585 is also quite old.

I'm not sure this had been said explicitly, but perhaps the original intent was to protect against accidentally redefining a local function. Obviously one could do this with a local variable too, though that might less often be an error?

toto <- function(mode) {
    tata <- function(a, b) a * b  # intended
    tata <- function(a, b) a / b  # oops
    ?
}

Another workaround is to actually name the local functions

toto <- function(mode) {
    tata <- function(a, b) a * b
    titi <- function(u, v, w) (u + v) / w
    if (mode == 1)
        tata
    else
        titi
}

? or to use a switch statement

toto <- function(mode) {
    ## fun <- switch(?) for use of `fun()` in toto
    switch(
        mode,
        tata = function(a, b) a * b,
        titi = function(u, v, w) (u + v) / w,
        stop("unknown `mode = '", mode, "'`")
    )
}

? or similarly to write `fun <- if ? else ?`, assigning the result of the `if` to `fun`. I guess this last formulation points to the fact that a more careful analysis of Herv?'s original code means that `fun` can only take one value (only one branch of the `if` can be taken) so there can only be one version of `fun` in any invocation of `toto()`.

Perhaps the local names (and string-valued 'mode') are suggestive of special case, so serve as implicit documentation?

Adding `?` to `tata` doesn't seem like a good idea; toto(1)(3, 5, 7) no longer signals an error.

There seems to be a lot in common with S3 and S4 methods, where `toto` corresponds to the generic, `tata` and `titi` to methods. This 'dispatch' is brought out by using `switch()`. There is plenty of opportunity for thinking that you're invoking one method but actually you're invoking the other. For instance with dplyr, I like that I can tbl |> print(n = 2) so much that I find myself doing this with data.frame df |> print(n = 2), which is an error (`n` partially matches `na.print`, and 2 is not a valid value); both methods silently ignore the typo print(m = 2).

Here's a dummy example that I think illustrates the problem:

toto <- function() {
  if (runif(1) < 0.5)
    function(a) a
  else
    function(a,b) a+b
}

> fcn <- toto()
> fcn(1,2)
[1] 3
> fcn <- toto()
> fcn(1,2)
[1] 3
> fcn <- toto()
> fcn(1,2)
Error in fcn(1, 2) : unused argument (2)

How can you use the returned function, if you get different arguments?

In your example, you cannot use the returned function without knowing
'mode', or by inspecting the returned function.  So, the warning is
there to alert you to a potential bug.  Anecdotally, I'm pretty sure
this R CMD check NOTE has caught at least one such bug in one of
my/our packages.

If you want to keep the current design pattern, one approach could be
to add ... to your function definitions:

toto <- function(mode)
{
     if (mode == 1)
         fun <- function(a, b, ...) a*b
     else
         fun <- function(u, v, w) (u + v) / w
     fun
}

to make sure that toto() returns functions that accept the same
minimal number of arguments.

Just to clarify, the above is outdated information - ever since the R-devel packages binaries are on CRAN the "development" option in the mac-builder is available.

And issues with that are rather rare (much rarer than numerical issues for non-reference x86_64 BLAS/LAPACKs).  Of the 20,300 CRAN packages just 18 have M1mac-specific errors, none obviously from numerical inaccuracy.  A quick look back suggests we get about 20 a year with M1mac numerical issues, about half of which were mirrored on the x86_64 'noLD' checks.

Subject: [Rd] round.Date and trunc.Date not working / implemented
Message-ID: <ab3376ac-5694-4a53-9606-c11bd97a4f0a@gmail.com>

This is my first time working with dates, so if the answer is "Duh, work 
with POSIXt", please ignore it.

Why is not `round.Date` and `trunc.Date` "implemented" for `Date`?

Is this because `Date` is (mostly) a virtual class setup for a better 
inheritance or is that something that is just missing? (like 
`sort.data.frame`). Would R core welcome a patch?

I decided to convert some dates to date using `as.Date` function, which 
converts to a plain `Date` class, because that felt natural.

But then when trying to round to closest year, I have realized that the 
`round` and `trunc` for `Date` do not behave as for `POSIXt`.

I would assume that these will have equivalent output:

Sys.time() |> round("years") # 2024-01-01 NZDT

Sys.Date() |> round("years") # Error in round.default(...): non-numeric 
argument to mathematical function


Looking at the code (and reading the documentation more carefully) shows 
the issue, but this looks like an omission that should be patched.

Hopefully to too much of a tangent: A related problem this check doesn?t catch is accidental top-level redefinitions in package code, such as

## a.R:
helper <- function() 1

f <- function() {
helper()
}
# ?cool, f() must return 1"

## b.R:
helper <- function(x) 2

g <- function() {
helper()
}
# ?cool, g() must return 2"

## Runtime: 
# > c(pkg::f(), pkg::g())
# [1] 2 2
# ?oh right, only the last definition of helper() is used?
 
I?ve seen several variants of this issue in code from folks who are new to package development, especially if they're naively refactoring something that started out as an interactively-run analysis. Collaborators who are puzzled by it get my ?packages are collections of objects not sequences of expressions, yes that needs to be in your mental model, here?s the link to RWE again? talk, but I would be happy to be able to point them to a check result to go along with it.

I don?t think this is grounds on its own to change a 20-year precedent, but in case anyone is collecting wishlist reasons to make the check look harder...

Thanks,
Chris

There is not. The internal stack is not safe to allow to escape to the
R level.  It would be possible to write a reflection function to
provide some information, but it would be a fair bit of work to design
and I don't think would be of enough value to justify that.

The original SO question would be better addressed to
Posit/RStudio. Someone with enough motivation might also be able to
figure out an answer by looking at the source code at
https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio.

Best,

luke

I agree a note about this sort of change might be good.

I think it wouldn't be too hard to write such a check to detect simple 
assignments using <- or =.  If you also wanted to detect method 
redefinitions, or redefinitions of functions stored in lists, etc., it 
would be harder.

There's unexported code in the pkgload package that will get you the 
list of R files in the correct collation order:  pkgload:::find_code . 
I don't know of such a function exported by some other package, but 
there might be one.  Once you have that list, you could parse each file 
and look for top level assignments to a name, then look for duplicates 
in the vector of names.

Here's a little script that finds cases where an R source file makes an 
assignment to a variable with the same name as one that was used earlier:

# Assume we are in the top level directory of a package.
Rfiles <- pkgload:::find_code()

allnames <- character()
for (f in Rfiles) {
   exprs <- parse(f)
   names <- character(length(exprs))
   for (i in seq_along(exprs)) {
     expr <- exprs[[i]]
     if (is.name(expr[[1]]) &&
         deparse(expr[[1]]) %in% c("<-", "=") &&
         is.name(expr[[2]])) {
       names[i] <- deparse(expr[[2]])
     }
   }
   names <- names[names != ""]
   prev <- length(allnames)
   allnames <- c(allnames, names)
   dups <- which(duplicated(allnames))
   dups <- dups[dups > prev]
   if (any(dups)) {
     cat("Duplicated names in ", basename(f), ":\n")
     cat(paste(allnames[dups], collapse = ", "), "\n")
   }
}

It could be made more fancy to report the locations of both the original 
and the dup if you feel motivated.

Collaborators who are puzzled by it get my ?packages are collections of objects not sequences of expressions, yes that needs to be in your mental model, here?s the link to RWE again? talk, but I would be happy to be able to point them to a check result to go along with it.

I guess this last formulation points to the fact that a more careful analysis of Herv?'s original code means that `fun` can only take one value (only one branch of the `if` can be taken) so there can only be one version of `fun` in any invocation of `toto()`.

I put the idea below into a function that gives nicer looking results. 
Here's the new code:

dupnames <- function(path = ".") {

   Rfiles <- pkgload:::find_code(path)
   allnames <- data.frame(names=character(), filename=character(), line 
= numeric())
   result <- NULL
   for (f in Rfiles) {
     exprs <- parse(f, keep.source = TRUE)
     locs <- getSrcLocation(exprs)
     names <- character(length(exprs))
     lines <- numeric(length(exprs))
     for (i in seq_along(exprs)) {
       expr <- exprs[[i]]
       if (is.name(expr[[1]]) &&
           deparse(expr[[1]]) %in% c("<-", "=") &&
           is.name(expr[[2]])) {
         names[i] <- deparse(expr[[2]])
         lines[i] <- locs[i]
       }
     }
     keep <- names != ""
     if (any(keep)) {
       names <- names[keep]
       lines <- lines[keep]

       prev <- nrow(allnames)
       allnames <- rbind(allnames, data.frame(name = names, filename = 
basename(f), line = lines))
       dups <- which(duplicated(allnames$name))
       dups <- dups[dups > prev]
       if (any(dups)) {
         origfile <- character(length(dups))
         origline <- numeric(length(dups))
         for (i in seq_along(dups)) {
           prev <- which(allnames$name == allnames$name[dups[i]])[1]
           origfile[i] <- allnames$filename[prev]
           origline[i] <- allnames$line[prev]
         }

         result <- rbind(result,
                         data.frame(name = allnames$name[dups],
                                    first = paste(origfile, origline, 
sep=":"),
                                    dup = paste(allnames$filename[dups], 
allnames$line[dups], sep = ":")))
       }
     }
   }
   result
}


And here's what I get when I run it on rgl:

dupnames("rgl")
   name      first          dup
1  fns knitr.R:12  knitr.R:165
2  fns knitr.R:12 pkgdown.R:14
3  fns knitr.R:12    shiny.R:8

Those are okay; the fns object is a temporary that is later removed in 
each case.

I guess this last formulation points to the fact that a more careful analysis of Herv?'s original code means that `fun` can only take one value (only one branch of the `if` can be taken) so there can only be one version of `fun` in any invocation of `toto()`.

Message-ID: <d2a753$lf9ru7@ironport10.mayo.edu>

 ?I've hit a roadblock debugging a new update to the survival package.?? I do debugging in 
a developement envinment, i.e. I don't create and load a package but rather? source all 
the .R files and dyn.load an .so file, which makes things a bit easier.

 ? Running with R -d "valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=full" one of my test files 
crashes in simple R code a dozen lines after the? likely culprit has been called, i.e, the 
survfit function for an Aalen-Johansen, containing a .Call to the new C code.???? The 
valgrind approach had already allowed me to find a few other (mostly dumb) errors that led 
to an out of bounds access, e.g., the wrong endpoint variable in a for( ) loop.??? What 
would others advise as a next step?

Here is the last part of the screen

The offending call is amost certainly the one to survfit; mysurv() is a local function 
that caculates some things 'by hand'. ? It does nothing complex: counts, loops, etc, the 
only non-base action is a call to Matrix::exp near the end, but the which() failure is 
well before that.

An unrelated allocation function suddenly dereferencing a null pointer
is likely indication of heap corruption. Valgrind may be silent about
it because the C heap (that it knows how to override and track) is still
intact, but the R memory management metadata got corrupted (which looks
like a valid memory access to Valgrind).

An easy solution could be brought by more instrumentation.

R can tell Valgrind to consider some memory accesses invalid if you
configure it using --with-valgrind-instrumentation [*], but I'm not
sure it will be able to trap overwriting GC metadata, so let's set it
aside for now.

If you compile your own R, you can configure it with -fsanitize=address
added to the compiler and linker flags [**]. I'm not sure whether the
bounds checks performed by AddressSanitizer would be sufficient to
catch the problem, but it's worth a try. Instead of compiling R with
sanitizers, it should be also possible to use the container image
docker.io/rocker/r-devel-san.

The hard option is left if no instrumentation lets you pinpoint the
error. Since the first (as far as Valgrind is concerned) memory error
already happens to result in a SIGSEGV, you can run R in a regular
debugger and try to work backwards from the local variables at the
location of the crash. Maybe there's a way to identify the block
containing the pointer that gets overwritten and set a watchpoint on
it for the next run of R. Maybe you can read the overwritten value as
double and guess where the number came from. If your processor is
sufficiently new, you can try `rr`, the time-travelling debugger [***],
to rewind the process execution back to the point where the pointer gets
overwritten.

I haven't done any R memory debugging lately, but

https://www.mail-archive.com/rcpp-devel at lists.r-forge.r-project.org/msg10289.html
shows how I used to have gdb break where valgrind finds a problem so you
could examine the details.

Also, running your code after running gctorture(TRUE) can help track down
memory problems.

You can use ^C to get the gdb prompt, to, say, set a breakpoint on
Rf_error or something in your code, and 'cont' or 'continue' to resume
running R.


You can get information about the status and history of a memory
location, say 0x12345678, with


(gdb) monitor vinfo location 0x12345678


More information is in https://valgrind.org/docs/manual/manual-core-adv.html.
