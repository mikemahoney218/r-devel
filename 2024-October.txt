Subject: [Rd] WRE about R_strtod
Message-ID: <20241008101618.6acf739c@Tarkus>

Hello,

This is what "Writing R extensions" currently says about R_atof and
R_strtod:

>> Function: void R_atof (const char* str)
>> Function: void R_strtod (const char* str, char ** end)
>>
>> Implementations of the C99/POSIX functions atof and strtod which
>> guarantee platform-dependent behaviour, including always using the
>> period as the decimal point aka ?radix character? and converting
>> "NA" to R?s NA_REAL_ . 

Besides the easily fixable return type (void -> double), shouldn't the
documentation mention the fact that, unlike the standard C library
functions, R's parser returns NA_REAL instead of 0 when no conversion
is performed (including for the "NA" string, *end == str)?

Subject: [Rd] Error message when calling t.test() and aov() with a factor
 variables
Message-ID: <AS8PR08MB91934F160E97429FAFEB78588B792@AS8PR08MB9193.eurprd08.prod.outlook.com>

Hi all,

Just noticed that the error that arises when calling t.test() with factors could be a bit clearer:

> t.test(factor(c(3,1,2,4,3,5,4,5)), factor(c(2,1,2,3,4,5)))
Error in var(x) : Calling var(x) on a factor x is defunct.
  Use something like 'all(duplicated(x)[-1L])' to test for a constant vector.
In addition: Warning message:
In mean.default(x) :
  argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA

Obviously, using factors as input is nonsense, but this might happen on accident and then the error message could be a bit more on point. Similar for aov():

> aov(factor(c(3,1,2,4,3,5,4,5)) ~ factor(c(2,1,2,2,2,1,2,1)))
Call:
   aov(formula = factor(c(3, 1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 4, 5)) ~ factor(c(2,
    1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1)))
Error in levels(x)[x] :
  only 0's may be mixed with negative subscripts
In addition: Warning messages:
1: In model.response(mf, "numeric") :
  using type = "numeric" with a factor response will be ignored
2: In Ops.factor(y, z$residuals) : '-' not meaningful for factors

Not a big deal and trying to catch all of the silly things users may do is of course impossible, but for this one adding a check that the (response) variable is actually numeric could be useful.

Best,
Wolfgang

Indeed.

As always, the question is whether we want to give an error unless
is.numeric, or ensure via as.numeric?

I would issue an error. Using as.numeric() could lead to totally nonsensical results, for example when:

as.numeric(factor(c("low","high","mid")))

Subject: [Rd] Embedding R in other applications as a scripting language
Message-ID: <CADPqqnKJ0js9cu2wBcAdXdJafJN1B308GHCh9rEMVmr_OkSYxA@mail.gmail.com>

I am subscribing to r-core because I am spending more and more time reading
the R implementation itself, but in the meantime I would love to discuss
the topic of embedding R (or linking against it) with more experienced C
developers and people who've written C or C++ code for R packages.

I have reached the stage where to make progress with embedding R in the
target application, TIC-80 (see https://tic80.com/), I need to study how R
is initialized in a finder detail. At the moment my plans for integrating R
include bundling the recommended packages in addition to magrittr (more
than that would be overkill for the integration).

The most relevant information I have seen on embedding R in other
applications *as a scripting language* comes from the
tests/Embedding/index.html document included in the R sources. At the
moment the Internet Archive is down while they deal with a DDOS attack
(thankfully their data are safe), so I can't access the PostgreSQL + R
documents linked to from there. No big matter.

I'm not particularly versed in C myself, but I can read it well and I
understand more each day I read the R implementation itself and expose
myself to the actual usage of non-trivial C. I read *Narain Gehani's C: an
Advanced Introduction* over the summer to familiarize myself with the
aspects of the language which weren't transparent to me from studying other
languages (Java, R, Emacs LISP, Python).

Anyhow, if anyone has experience playing with this since it was more
popular twenty years ago (as it seems) please reply!

Regards, and thanks for all the pirate jokes. R!

Hi all,

I'm new to contributing to r-devel. The trunk of r-devel right now includes
a `check_rust()` function for adherence to CRAN's evolving rust policy (see
commit
https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/commit/6114d4126434c056b476cbc5db2657536c153d9a
).

As it stands R 4.4.2 will codify CRAN policy on Rust as the R language's
policy and will have deep implications for the language moving forward.  It
would make *any* package that uses Rust to adhere to their policies.

I've submitted an issue as well as a patch at
https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18806.

What is the process for submitting the bug and patch for review?

Bryce,

embedding R varies from easy to very complex depending on what you want to do with it. If all you want is to evaluate R commands and get the result values then it is easy: you just initialize R with Rf_initialize_R() and use R_tryEval() to evaluate what you need (making sure you stay on the main thread). However, if you want to run the full event loop or even use the GUI elements then it gets more complicated - you  can have a look at https://github.com/s-u/rJava/blob/master/jri/src/Rinit.c which is short enough to illustrate the entry points and purposes.

If you are willing to use C++ then RInside is a nice package that wraps the R API in C++ classes for easier use: https://github.com/eddelbuettel/rinside simplifying it quite a bit.

Cheers,
Simon

PS: this list is for the discussions on *development* of R itself, please consider using the R-help mailing list instead which is where users discuss the *use* of R in various scenarios.

R 4.4.2 will be released from the R-4-4-branch, not from the trunk. The 
change you have pointed to is only on the trunk, which would eventually 
become the next minor release, probably 4.5.0. Anything on the trunk is 
subject to change.

See https://svn.r-project.org/R/branches/R-4-4-branch/src vs 
https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk

See https://www.r-project.org/bugs.html

But in short, submitting a PR to bugzilla about this as you have done is 
fine. Now it is the turn for R Core to consider if this should be a 
CRAN-only check or not.

Best
Tomas

Hi Bryce,

Thanks for mention, Simon! And yes, embedding R is remarkably stable. Simon's
own rServe and rJava were early, and still provide a reference. There was
also (decades ago !) the embedding of R inside Postgres by Joe Conway. Jeff
later did RApache, this lead to littler on which I leaned for RInside.

Now, RInside may be of interest for two or three reason. First, it uses C++
and therefore abstract a few things (including the initialization) away into
an easy to use C++ class. Second, by being in C++ it can take advantage of
the templated converters to/from basic C/C++ types and class to R and back
making the use easier. Lastly, there are a number of examples included in the
source repo below inst/examples/ in seven different directories:
  https://github.com/eddelbuettel/rinside/tree/master/inst/examples

Hope this helps,  Dirk
